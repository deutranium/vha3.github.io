As the motor spins increasingly quickly ($\\omega$ rad/sec), the thrust that it generates ($F_{thrust}$) exceeds the force of gravity ($F_g$) and lifts the arm to increasingly large angles $\\theta$ away from the vertical. This is the system that we will build and control in ECE 4760. The user will specify a target angle, $\\theta$, and a PID controller will control the motor speed to drive the arm to that angle. This document aims to systematically build an intuition for the system and for the controller that we'll use to control this system.\n",

    "One strategy for controlling this system is **open loop control**. The control input to the motor is a voltage. 0 voltage means that the motor is not spinning, and increasing voltages lead to increasing motor speeds (up to some saturation speed). So, for each possible input voltage, we could solve for the output motor speed associated with that voltage. With a little physics, you could then solve for the angle $\\theta$ that will be achieved for each input voltage. In principle, this reduces the control problem to a lookup table. For a particular target angle, the program would lookup the control voltage associated with that angle and blindly apply that voltage to the motor. This is illustrated in the block diagram below. The open-loop system takes a control input, physics happens, and there is an output. The control input is not adjusted based on the output. What's the problem with this?\n",

    "The problem is that this makes the accuracy of our system extremely sensitive to the conditions under which it was modeled and/or calibrated. If we were to run our system in Colorado, we'd find that we'd consistently come up short of our target angles (since the atmospheric density would be less). If we bumped our setup and the motor tilted slightly, we'd start seeing errors. As the motor warms or ages and its properties change, we'd see errors. Any load on the system, any change in the system, or any change in the environment would induce an error. **For every desired hover angle, there does exist a motor speed that will achieve that angle. But how well can you know that motor speed, and how constant is it over time and from environment to environment?**\n",

Over time, we expect that this will stabilize to a constant value that keeps the arm at precisely the commanded angle. But, this term can create problems in some situations.\n",

It will only begin to decrease once the arm is released and moves past the commanded hover angle. But if you've restrained the arm for too long, the motor will stay saturated for *a long time after the arm moves past the desired angle*. The integrator term will have accumulated so much magnitude that it will take a long time for it to come back down and for the motor to slow.

When the system sees the initial error of 1070 ADC units, we'd like for it to set the PWM duty cycle to about 25000. That implies a $K_p$ of about $\\frac{25000}{1070} \\approx 23$.

If we want the motor on full throttle when it sees an error of 250 ADC units, this suggest a $K_p$ of approximately $\\frac{40000}{250} = 160$.

We'd like for the contribution from this term to be *non-negligible*, which suggests that we'd like for it to be of approximately the same magnitude as the proportional term. These measurement differences are 2-3 orders of magnitude smaller than the error measurements used by the proportional term (depending how many samples back you look for the derivative approximation, see previous section). So, we expect for $K_d$ to be 2-3 orders of magnitude *larger* than $K_p$. In the range of 1000's-10000's. Perhaps you start with around 1000.\n",

    "Start with just a proportional gain. Increase this gain until the system is on the edge of stability (oscillating) and then add some derivative gain to suppress overshoot and oscillation. Get the system to respond quickly by increasing $K_p$, and suppress overshoot using $K_d$. Then add a bit of integral gain $K_i$ to eliminate steady state error."
