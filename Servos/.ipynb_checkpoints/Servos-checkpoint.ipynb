In the first lab, you built a tool for understanding birdsong. In the second, you built a tool for understanding flocking behavior. In the third lab, you built a tool for doing realtime frequency analysis. The outcome of this lab will not be a tool that could be used for some other purpose. Instead, the objective of this lab is to *build something that makes you smile.* The extent to which a couple of simple behaviors can give a robot a personality is remarkable. In this lab, you are tasked with creating that personality, subject to a couple constraints. One of those constraints is that the robot must react to your voice."
