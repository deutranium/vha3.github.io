    "This project was meant to provide an objective thru which to build understanding of multicore capabilities on the RP2040. For this project, I instantiated a timer interrupt on both core 0 and core 1. [Direct digital synthesis](https://vha3.github.io/DDS/DDS.html) is performed separately on each core, and each core writes to a separate channel of the SPI DAC. The consequence is that the A output of the DAC is an an 800 Hz sine wave being generated on core 1, and the B output of the DAC is a 400 Hz sine wave being generated on core 0. A simple state machine amplitude-modulates these sine waves to 1Hz \"beeps.\" Because the RP2040 buffers SPI writes, no spinlock is required to control each core's access to the SPI channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "A spinlock is used in the main program of each core to control access to a global variable. Each core locks the variable, increments it by 10 (printing as it does so), and then unlocks it so that the other core can lock/increment. Experimentation shows that a small delay is required after unlocking for the other core to reliably take control of the spinlock.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the code is provided in a listing in the first section of this page. The rest of the page walks through the C source file from top to bottom, explaining each line of code. Lastly, I've included some plots output plots from the oscilloscope and compared the measured output frequencies to the expected output frequencies."

Two of these are standard C headers (`stdio.h` and `math.h`) and the others are headers which come from the C SDK for the Raspberry Pi Pico. The first of these, `pico/stdlib.h` is what the SDK calls a \"High-Level API.\" These high-level API's \"provide higher level functionality that isn’t hardware related or provides a richer set of functionality above the basic hardware interfaces.\" The architecture of this SDK is described at length in the SDK manual. All libraries within the SDK are `INTERFACE` libraries. `pico/stdlib.h` in particular pulls in a number of lower-level hardware libraries, listed on page 196 of the C SDK guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "`pico/multicore.h` is another high-level API. This adds support for running code on core 1, and includes the inter-core FIFO module for popping/pushing data between the two cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next two includes pull in hardware API's which are *not* already brought in by `pico/stdlib.h` or `pico/multicore.h`. These include `hardware/sync.h` and `hardware/spi.h`. As the names suggest, these two interface libraries give us access to the API's associated with the multicore synchronization spinlocks and SPI peripherals on the RP2040. *Don't forget to link these in the CMakeLists.txt file!*"

    "The entry point for core 0 is `main()`. This function calls `stdio_init_all()` to setup stdio/uart on the RP2040, prints a greeting, and then sets up the SPI channel. For an extended discussion of setting up SPI on the 2040 and mapping GPIO ports, please see [this webpage](https://vha3.github.io/Pico/DAC/DMA_DAC.html). The code then builds the sine table which will be used by *each core* for DDS, then claims and initializes the spinlock which the two cores will use to control access to the global counting variable. Note that we are calling `spin_lock_unsafe_blocking` and `spin_unlock_unsafe`. The \"unsafe\" means that interrupts are **not disabled**. For this application, that is what I want, since I want for DDS to continue on each core.\n",
    "\n",
    "Core 0 then launches core 1, specifying the function on which core 1 should enter, and creates an object of type `repeating_timer` (see previous section). A repeating timer is then built by calling `add_repeating_timer_us()`, which is very similar to `alarm_pool_add_repeating_timer_us()` except that it uses the default alarm pool. As previously explained, the default alarm pool is on core 0 and uses hardware alarm 3. The `while(1)` loop on core 0 is identical to that on core 1.\n",

    "Each of these cores will interrupt at audio-rate, compute a new DDS output and send it over SPI to the DAC. Meanwhile, they use the spinlock to trade access to a global incrementing variable."
