    "A computer worm is a program that replicates and propagates itself across a network. Typically associated with malware, this project deploys a worm for good!

    "One scalable approach to reprogramming a *huge* collection of devices is to reprogram a *single* device, and to have that program spread (like a virus or a computer worm) to other devices that it encounters. You then get an exponential spread of firmware updates across the swarm.\n",

    "## Modifying the serial bootloader\n",
    "\n",
    "[This webpage](https://vanhunteradams.com/Pico/Bootloader/Bootloader.html) describes a custom serial bootloader which we will modify so that it behaves like a worm. As described on that webpage, this serial bootloader lives directly above the [stage 2 bootloader](https://vanhunteradams.com/Pico/Bootloader/Boot_sequence.html#Boot-stage-2) in RP2040 memory, and receives new executable programs via a [wireless UART interface](https://vanhunteradams.com/Pico/Bootloader/Infrared.html). This bootloader has the ability to replace existing user application code, and it has the ability to detect and branch to valid programs in flash memory. The user can force the device into bootloader mode via a GPIO port, or an application program can force the device into bootloader mode by writing to a watchdog scratch register and then executing a soft reset.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the system comes out of reset, the bootloader asks itself the following questions, in the following order:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Am I supposed to go directly into bootloader mode?\n",
    "> - **Yes**: Skip straight to step 3.\n",
    "> - **No**: Go to step 2.\n",
    "2. Is there already a valid program in my flash memory?\n",
    "> - **Yes**: Branch straight to it!\n",
    "> - **No**: Go to step 3.\n",
    "3. Start the bootloader, and wait to serially receive a new program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mechanisms by which it asks and answers these questions are discussed at length on the [serial bootloader webpage](https://vanhunteradams.com/Pico/Bootloader/Bootloader.html). In order to allow for the RP2040 to share its *own* application code in a worm-like fashion, we are going to modify the above sequence of questions and actions to the following:\n",

    "## Telling the bootloader to share its program\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to determine whether it should share its valid program, the bootloader must check *something* to see if the user (or a program which forced a soft reset) is commanding the RP2040 to enter worm mode to share its program. In fact, the bootloader allows for the user to force the system into worm mode by holding down a button attached to a GPIO port, and it also allows for a program to force the system into bootloader mode using a watchdog peripheral scratch register.\n",
    "\n",
    "The watchdog peripheral can perform a soft reset of the RP2040, and it offers eight scratch registers which retain their value through a soft reset (but, importantly, not through a hard reset). These scratch registers are described on page 548 of the RP2040 datasheet. If a program wants to force the system back into bootloader mode, it writes a 1 to watchdog scratch register 1 and then forces a soft reset. After the soft reset, the bootloader will check both a GPIO and scratch register 1 for an answer to question 1 above."

The checksum is the 2's complement of the LSB of the sum of all bytes in the packet which precede the checksum.

The second byte represents the most-significant 8 bits of the least-significant 16-bits of the base address for the data payload (the most significant 16 are in the extended linear address packet, per the Intel standard). The next byte is the least-significant 8 bits of the least-significant 16 bits of the address. The next byte is the record type (`0x00`, which represents \"data\").
