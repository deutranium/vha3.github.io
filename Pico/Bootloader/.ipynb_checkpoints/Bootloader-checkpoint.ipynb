Please note that the content of this webpage is likely clearest if the reader has some understanding of the RP2040 boot sequence.

    "## What is a bootloader?\n",
    "\n",
    "On a microcontroller, a *bootloader* is a program that is responsible for loading and running other programs. The bootloader is how the microcontroller knows how to receive, load, and start executing the programs that we write for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that we are able to program the microcontrollers that we buy, perhaps it stands to reason that part of the bootloader is \"baked in\" to ROM, making it difficult or impossible to change. If the microcontroller didn't come with the bootloader already loaded into memory, it wouldn't know how to receive or execute any new programs. And if our programs were to overwrite the bootloader, we would brick our microcontroller by making it impossible to reprogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, it's often the case that some of the later \"stages\" of the bootloader do live in programmable memory. The RP2040, for example, uses to two-stage bootloader. The RP2040 uses a two-stage bootloader. The first stage of this bootloader lives in ROM, and the second stage of the bootloader lives in the first 256 bytes of flash. The RP2040 stores executable programs in *external* flash memory, and is the responsibility of the two-stage bootloader configure this external flash memory. This means setting up the GPIO pins which are used to communicate with this external flash memory over a QSPI interface, and it means configuring the chip itself for execute-in-place (XIP) execution of the user's code. For a more detailed description of this process, please see [this webpage](https://vanhunteradams.com/Pico/Bootloader/Boot_sequence.html). The user's application code starts immediately after the stage 2 bootloader in flash memory. The figure below shows the location in address-space of the bootrom, stage 2 bootloader, user application code, stack pointer, etc. The information in this figure comes from page 24 of the [RP2040 datasheet](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp2040/rp2040-datasheet.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "**INSERT ADDRESS MAP DIAGRAM**\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to modify this address map by adding a *third stage* to the RP2040 boot process. This third stage will live directly below the second stage of the bootloader (where the user application code starts in the default address map), and the user application code will be moved down below this custom third-stage bootloader. See the figure below. \n",
    "\n",
    "**INSERT NEW ADDRESS MAP**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our third-stage bootloader will have the following responsibilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the programmer wants to *replace* the user application code in flash memory, erase the existing program and re-write the appropriate section of flash memory with the new program.\n",
    "2. If a valid user application code exists in flash memory, run it! \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to carry out these two responsibilities, the bootloader must have a way of *knowing* whether or not a valid application exists, and it must have a way of receiving a new program from an external device to write to its own flash memory. This mechanism for receiving a new program could, in principle, be any communication interface. For simplicity and (hopefully) maximal utility, this particular bootloader receives new programs via a UART serial interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the executable program which it receives must be compiled in accordance with our *new* memory map. By default, RP2040 programs are compiled with their base load address set to 0x10000000 (the base address of flash memory). As shown above and explained previously, the stage 2 bootloader starts at address 0x10000000 and extends for 256 bytes, and is then followed immediately by the user's application code. In order for the programs which our custom bootloader loads into flash memory to *work*, they must be compiled with their base load address set to the address just beneath our custom stage 3 bootloader. The bootloader itself, of course, will use the default base address which places it just below boot stage 2. Configuring these destination load addresses will require some gentle modification of the *linker script*.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could discuss these various topics in any order. To hopefully improve clarity by adding some narrative structure to this explanation, we'll discuss them in an order which allows for us to follow a new program as it moves from the compiler, through our custom bootloader, and into flash memory before being executed. To that end, we'll discuss the following topics in the following order:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Modifying the linker script for a custom program load address.\n",
    "2. Understanding the .hex file generated by the compiler, with the custom linker script.\n",
    "3. Loading this .hex file, line-by-line, through a serial interface into our custom bootloader.\n",
    "4. How the bootloader checksums each line of the new program and places it into flash memory.\n",
    "5. How the bootloader vectors into a fully-loaded program.\n",
    "6. How we tell the RP2040 to go *back* to bootloader mode from the executing program in order to receive a new one.\n"

    "## Modifying the linker script\n",
    "\n",
    "We would like for our compiled application program to be loaded *above* our custom bootloader in flash memory. This requires modifying the *linker script*, which organizes the object files that the compiler generates according to our desired memory layout. I've separated this section into two subsections: Background Information and Linker Modifications. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that I've borrowed much of the Background Information section from one of my [other webpages](https://vanhunteradams.com/Pico/Bootloader/Boot_sequence.html#Brief-tangent-on-linker-scripts). Some of the information is included here also to (hopefully) improve readability of this webpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please also note that there's a lot of background information provided here, but the ultimate modification that we'll make to the linker script is very minor!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background information\n",
    "\n",
    "A translation process occurs to transform the source code which we humans write to the machine code that the microcontroller runs. This process begins with the compiler, which takes our source code (e.g. C programs) as input, and generates machine code in the form of *object files* as an output. These object files are generated into different *sections*. The details of these sections depend on the object format used by the compiler, but a very common one is the Executable Linkable Format (ELF). A compiler which uses the ELF object file format will generate object files in the following sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `.text`: Executable code $\\longrightarrow$ generally in flash, unless copied to RAM (possible on RP2040)\n",
    "- `.data`: Initialized data (i.e. variables) $\\longrightarrow$ RAM\n",
    "- `.bss` : Uninitizialized data (i.e. variables) $\\longrightarrow$ RAM\n",
    "- `.const`: Constant data (and the original home of initialized data which will be copied to `.data`) $\\longrightarrow$ flash\n",
    "\n",
    "The object files generated by the compiler do not yet have associated memory addresses in the target microcontroller. It's the job of the *linker script* to organize the object files generated by the compiler in accordance with the memory layout for the target microcontroller as specified (generally) by that microcontroller's datasheet or (in our case) for compatibility with a custom bootloader. It specifies things like the location and size of flash and RAM, the location of the stack and heap, where .bss should be initialized, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at the RP2040's [default linker script](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk/blob/master/src/rp2_common/pico_standard_link/memmap_default.ld) to see how this works. At the top of the linker script, we find the memory layout specified:\n",
    "\n",
    "```linker\n",
    "MEMORY\n",
    "{\n",
    "    FLASH(rx) : ORIGIN = 0x10000000, LENGTH = 2048k\n",
    "    RAM(rwx) : ORIGIN =  0x20000000, LENGTH = 256k\n",
    "    SCRATCH_X(rwx) : ORIGIN = 0x20040000, LENGTH = 4k\n",
    "    SCRATCH_Y(rwx) : ORIGIN = 0x20041000, LENGTH = 4k\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This specifies the *base address* (i.e. ORIGIN) of each relevant section of memory, the readability/writability/executability of that part of memory, and the length of that part of memory. So, for instance, we see that flash memory starts at address 0x10000000, and that it is 2048 kilobytes long. RAM starts at 0x20000000 and is 256 kilobytes long. The subsequent section of the linker script (the `SECTIONS` section) organizes all of the object files generated by the compiler according to this memory layout. **By the way**, if we wanted to store our program code *elsewhere* in flash (say, because we had to put it above a custom bootloader), we could do so by simply adjusting the origin and length of the FLASH part of the memory layout. More on that in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of those object files created by the compiler will contain some or all of the sections mentioned previously (`.text`, `.data`., `.bss`., etc.). The SECTIONS part of the linker script organizes all those input sections into output sections, and places those output sections in memory. We could absolutely do this by naming every single section from every single object file, but that doesn't scale very well. So, we'll use some shortcuts. \n",
    "\n",
    "But let's begin by looking at the very top of the SECTIONS part of the linker script, where we will find the stage 2 bootlaoder (described in more detail [here](https://vanhunteradams.com/Pico/Bootloader/Boot_sequence.html#Boot-stage-2)). Every code snippet in the rest of this section lives in the SECTIONS { } part of the linker.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    .flash_begin : {\n",
    "        __flash_binary_start = .;\n",
    "    } > FLASH\n",
    "\n",
    "    .boot2 : {\n",
    "        __boot2_start__ = .;\n",
    "        KEEP (*(.boot2))\n",
    "        __boot2_end__ = .;\n",
    "    } > FLASH\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first stanza creates an output section called `.flash_begin`, but it doesn't actually load anything into flash! All that it does is set the value of a *symbol* (essentially a variable, which will be accessible by our reset handler) to \".\". The dot, in the context of the linker script, represents the *current memory address* in the linker script. Because we haven't loaded anything into memory yet, this dot represents the base address of flash memory. We store this base address in a symbol called `__flash_binary_start`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second stanza creates an output section called `.boot2`. We associate a symbol with the start of the `.boot2` section, and then we use an escape character to ask the linker to please load all object files with names including \".boot2\" to flash memory at this address. We can confirm that everything is going to the expected places in memory by looking at the *map file* (one of the outputs of the linker). The map file specifies precisely what lives at every address in memory. I can't provide a link to the map file, because it's generated by the compiler when you compile your code. Here, for instance, is a snippet from the map file for the blinky demo:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ".flash_begin    0x0000000010000000        0x0\n",
    "                0x0000000010000000                __flash_binary_start = .\n",
    "\n",
    ".boot2          0x0000000010000000      0x100\n",
    "                0x0000000010000000                __boot2_start__ = .\n",
    " *(.boot2)\n",
    " .boot2         0x0000000010000000      0x100 \n",
    "                0x0000000010000100                __boot2_end__ = .\n",
    "                0x0000000000000001                \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that the flash binary start is at address `0x0000000010000000`, and that the first item loaded into flash memory, at that base address, is `.boot2`. We also see that the address associated with `__boot2_end__` is `0x0000000010000100`, or precisely 256 bytes above the base address.\n",
    "\n",
    "And this pattern continues. The linker script organizes all of the input sections from the compiler into output sections which are compatible with the memory layout of our device, and which meet our application needs. We are going to modify this linker script in accordance with our desired memory layout. In particular, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Move the origin of flash memory to an address which is *above* our custom bootloader, and adjust the length of flash memory accordingly.\n",
    "2. Eliminate the stage 2 bootloader, since we don't need it for our application code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at how we can do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linker modifications\n",
    "\n",
    "The modified linker script for the bootloader application is **linked here.** Note that there are only two changes! The first is that the memory layout has been updated to:\n",
    "\n",
    "```linker\n",
    "MEMORY\n",
    "{\n",
    "    FLASH(rx) : ORIGIN = 0x10000000 + 12k, LENGTH = 2048k - 12k\n",
    "    RAM(rwx) : ORIGIN =  0x20000000, LENGTH = 256k\n",
    "    SCRATCH_X(rwx) : ORIGIN = 0x20040000, LENGTH = 4k\n",
    "    SCRATCH_Y(rwx) : ORIGIN = 0x20041000, LENGTH = 4k\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We've moved the origin for flash memory *up* 12 kilobytes (which happens to be the size of the bootloader, more on that soon), and we've decreased the total length of the flash memory region by 12 kilobytes. Now, when the linker script specifies that an output section should be placed into flash, the *base address* at which those sections *start* getting loaded is 0x10008000.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only other change that we've made to the linker script is to comment out the .boot2 section, since we don't want it! So, we now expect to look into our map file and find the vector table at our *new* base flash address. And indeed, we do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ".flash_begin    0x0000000010008000        0x0\n",
    "                0x0000000010008000                __flash_binary_start = .\n",
    "\n",
    ".text           0x0000000010008000     0x24e0\n",
    "                0x0000000010008000                __logical_binary_start = .\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And we will leave the linker script for our custom bootloader itself unmodified, because we want boot2 included in that compilation, and the default linker will already place it where we want it in memory (right above boot2)!"

That line is `pico_set_linker_script(blinky ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/test_memmap.ld)` where blinky is the arbitrarily-chosen executable name for the application, and test_memmap.ld is our custom linker script. When we compile this project, the compiler will generate a bunch of object files, the linker will organize those object files according to our specified memory map, and a collection of machine-code output files will be generated and placed into the `build` directory.

    "Some of these fields require clarification. The byte count is the length of the data field, in bytes, represented in hexadecimal. The address relates to the load address in memory for that particular data field (more on that in a moment), and the record type specifies what the data in that particular line *means*. There are a handful of different record types, a brief description of each is offered in the table below. These are of critical importance to our custom bootloader, since they let us know what to do with each hexline that we receive.\n",

    "|`02`|**Extended segment address**: The data field contains a 16-bit segment base address. To compute the address of subsequent messages, this data field is treated as the most-significant 16-bits of a 32-bit address, where the lower 16-bits are specified by the address field of that message. |\n",
    "|`03`|**Start segment address**: Only used in 80x86 processors, not of relevance to us.|\n",
    "|`04`|**Extended linear address**: Allows for 32-bit addressing. The address field is ignored, and the data is always 2 bytes long. These 2 data bytes represent the most significant 16 of the 32-bit addresses for all subsequent `00`-record-type messages. So, for instance, the absolute address for line 2 above is 0x10008000, which matches the map file and linker script.|\n",
    "|`05`|**Extended start address**: The four data bytes represent a 32-bit address value (big-endian). In the case of CPUs that support it, this 32-bit address is the address at which execution should start. For us, this points to the _entry_point, as specified in the linker file. Our bootloader won't actually use this, however, because it knows where applications live in memory.|\n",
    "\n",
    "The final byte is the checksum. The checksum is the two's compliment of the least significant byte of the sum of all of the decoded byte values which precede it in its line. This is most obviously apparent in the final line above, where the sum of all bytes which precede the checksum is 1, with a 2's compliment (flip all bits and add 1) of `0xFF`.\n",
    "\n",
    "All we are going to do is send this hexfile to our bootloader one line at a time. The bootloader will use the record type of the message to determine what should be done with it. The bootloader will move the information from the `data` fields of the `Data` record-type messages to the addresses specified by their `address` fields. Once it receives the `End of file` record type, it will vector into the newly-loaded application. Let's consider this in more detail."
