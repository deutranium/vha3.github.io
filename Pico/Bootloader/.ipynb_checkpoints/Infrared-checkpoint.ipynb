    "The TSOP34156 demodulates bursts of 56kHz infrared light. In order for this demodulation to occur without error, those bursts need to generated according to the specifications described in the table at the bottom of [page 5 of the datasheet](./TSOP.pdf). These specifications relate to the number of cycles per burst, the gap time between bursts, and the maximum number of continuous burst per second. If the bursts are generated according to these specifications, the automatic gain control in the receiver does a good job rejecting noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we drive an IR LED from a 56kHz PWM channel and use a 4800 baud UART TX line to (effectively) modulate that PWM channel on/off, then we end up with a number of cycles per burst that is about right for the TSOP34156. In particular, we get 11-12 cycles per bit. If we allow for a short gap between characters, the error rate over short transmission distances is very low (but not zero). I haven't run a full statistical test, but it seems to lose 1 bit every 10,000 or so. For applications in which any bit error is not permissable (e.g. a [serial bootloader](https://vanhunteradams.com/Pico/Bootloader/Bootloader.html)), checksums and handshakes detect errors and request retransmissions. An RC lowpass filter has been added, per the datasheet, to reduce supply ripple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the output signal goes *low* when the receiver *detects* IR flashing at 56kHz. This signal attaches directly to the UART RX input. So, we need for the transmitter to generate 51kHz cycles when the UART TX line is *high* and to stop generating pulses (which makes the receiver signal go high) when the UART TX line is *low*. A PNP transistor facilitates this."

    "### The infrared LED\n",
    "\n",
    "The IR LED is constantly driven by a 56kHz PWM output. The low-side of the LED connects to the emitter of a PNP transistor, the base of which is driven by the UART TX line and the collector of which connects to ground. This way, current flows through the LED when the TX line is low, and it does not flow through the LED when the TX line is high. This *inverts* the TX signals. The UART TX line idles high, which turns *off* the PNP resistor and prevents the IR LED from flashing. As a consequence, the signal line connected to the RX input of the receiving device goes *high*. When the UART TX signal goes *low*, the LED is allowed to flash the the signal output of the TSOP34156 goes low. The microcontroller has no idea that there isn't a wired connection between RX and TX.\n",
    "\n",
    "At present, the IR LED is driven directly from the PWM output. These LED's can take up to 40mA. With one more NPN transistor, you could drive *way* more current through that LED for longer-distance transmissions."
