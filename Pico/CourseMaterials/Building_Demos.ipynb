    "1. Download [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com), if you don't already have it on your machine.\n",
    "2. Download the [ECE 4760 VSCode Extension](https://cornell.box.com/shared/static/s7e73e8j1h4yj5ctpu1ybip7o939gws0.vsix). This is a fork and gentle modification of the Raspberry Pi Pico extension.\n",
    "3. Open VSCode, and click the Extensions icon.\n",
    "4. At the top-right of the Extensions window click the \"...\" button and select \"Install from VSIX\" from the drop-down menu that appears.\n",
    "5. In the file-explorer window that appears, select the .vsix file that you downloaded in step 2 above and click Install.\n",
    "6. A new extension icon will appear at the left-side of the screen that says \"4760.\" Click it, and select \"New Project From Example.\"\n",
    "7. Select the \"Blinky\" example from the dropdown menu, select \"Pico\" as the board type, and choose any location that you'd like for the project. For your debugger, select \"DebugProbe,\" then click \"Create.\"\n",
    "8. A new window will open that contains your project. Click \"Compile\" at the bottom of the screen to build the project. To load the project onto your Pico, hold down the Bootsel button and plug it in. Then click the \"Run\" icon at the bottom of the screen.\n"
