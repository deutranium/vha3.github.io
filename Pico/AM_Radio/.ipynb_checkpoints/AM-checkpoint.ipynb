    "An AM radio operates by modulating the amplitude of a carrier wave with a lower-frequency message-carrying wave. Often, that message-carrying wave is an audio waveform. In this project, the carrier wave is approximated by a PWM signal generated by the RP2040, and the audio waveform modulates its average amplitude by modifying its duty cycle. Over short ranges, the fields generated by these PWM waves in a short jumper cable can be picked up and demodulated by an AM radio, as shown below."

    "This application uses zero CPU-time, making use exclusively of peripherals. The ADC is configured to free-running mode, and gathers new samples at 10kHz. Each of these samples is truncated to 8 bits, and put into the ADC FIFO. A DMA channel, paced by `DREQ_ADC`, moves each of these samples as it appears from the FIFO to the first index of a 4-element character array (all other elements zero). This DMA channel chains to a second DMA channel, which moves the character array to the counter compare register for the PWM channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PWM channel is configured with a clock divider of 1, and a wrapval of 255. The RP2040 is overclocked to 250MHz, so the frequency of the square wave is ~980kHz. When the DMA channel moves an 8-bit (0-255) value from the ADC FIFO to the counter compare register, the duty cycle for the square wave will be adjusted on the next rising edge. A wrapval of 255 was chosen so that the ADC samples could set the duty cycle directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This second DMA channel then chains back to the first, which waits for a new sample to appear in the ADC FIFO.\n",

    "## Stepping thru the code\n",
    "\n",
    "A listing of all of the code is provided at the bottom of this webpage, and available in [this repository](https://github.com/vha3/Hunter-Adams-RP2040-Demos/tree/master/More_Demos/AM_Radio_Voice). This section provides a brief commentary on each section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Includes, macros, and global variables\n",
    "\n",
    "The project includes three standard C libraries, two high-level SDK libraries, and three hardware interface libraries. In particular, it includes the interface libraries to the PWM peripheral, the ADC, and the DMA. Macros are used to associate names with parameter values, and a couple of global variables are declared. `slice_num` is an unsigned int which will store the slice number for the PWM channel that we are using, and `new_duty` is a character array into which one DMA channel will place ADC samples, and from which a second DMA channel will move data to the counter compare register.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is `new_duty` a four-element character array? I was experimenting with the consequences of having a mismatch between DMA transfer data size and destination data size. In order to perform DMA transfers out of the ADC FIFO, the channel must be configured for a transfer data size of 8 bits. Experimentation shows that pointing this DMA channel to a 32-bit wide `unsigned int` works (the data ends up in the bottom 8 bits of that variable). But! If one specifies the destination address to be a register, then those 8 bits are *copied* four times into the 32-bit register. I deduced this by printing the value contained at a register (in particular, the CC register for PWM slice 2) before and after a DMA transaction. Alternatively, a 32-bit transaction from an 8-bit source put some garbage data (from adjacent memory?) into the register. Experimentation showed that a 32-bit transaction from a character array worked. An 8-bit DMA transfer from the ADC FIFO to an unsigned int, then a 32-bit transaction from the unsigned int to the register, would also work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main\n",
    "\n",
    "#### System configuration and initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line in main overclocks the system PLL to 250 MHz. This is because I knew that I wanted for the PWM wrapval to be 255, so I needed for the system clock to be fast enough for a PWM channel with a 255 wrapval to still be in the AM radio frequency range. The default clock rate of 125MHz would have made the PWM frequency ~490kHz, which is a little low.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### PWM configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "The PWM channel is configured with a wrapval of 255 (so that it can be set directly from the ADC samples) and a clock divider of 1 (so that it runs as fast as possible). I experimented a bit with modifying the drive strength and slew rate of the GPIO toggled by the PWM peripheral, to no discernable effect. I thought perhaps that modifying the slew rate would be a mechanism by which I could implement FM transmissions on one of the higher-frequency harmonics of the square wave. Doesn't seem to work for that though.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ADC configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "The ADC is configured per datasheet specifications for interaction with a DMA channel. In particular, it is configured to write gathered samples to the FIFO, enable the DMA DREQ when any sample appears in the FIFO, disable the error bit, and truncate to 8 bit samples. The ADC clock is configured to overflow at 10 MHz, but the ADC is **not started** until after the DMA channels are configured and started. Order for these operations matters!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### DMA configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Two DMA channels are configured, each of which chains to the other. The first DMA channel moves data from the ADC FIFO to the first element of the `new_duty` character array. This channel is paced by `DREQ_ADC`, so that a transaction occurs each time a new sample appears in the FIFO. After each transaction, the second DMA channel is triggered to move the ADC data from the character array to the counter compare register for the PWM channel, and then restart the first channel to wait for the next sample. As such, the duty cycle for the PWM wave adjusts automatically each time the ADC generates a sample."
