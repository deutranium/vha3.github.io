    "This webpage describes a method for interfacing a 3x4 matrix keypad, like the one pictured in Fig. 1, with an RP2040. Other methods for building this interface exist (this would be a nice application for the PIO coprocessors, for instance). The particular method described on this page is the one that I think is most educationally useful in [ECE 4760](https://ece4760.github.io).\n",

For each of the input pins, we will enable internal pullup resistors. To start, we'll set all the output GPIO's attached *low.*\n",

    "### Scanning for presses\n",
    "\n",
    "The RP2040 allows for us to get the state of *all* of the GPIO ports using `gpio_get_all()`. This returns a 32-bit unsigned int, each bit of which represents the state (high or low) of the associated GPIO port (bit 0 is GPIO 0, bit 1 is GPIO 1, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "We scan the keypad by setting the GPIO's attached to the columns of the matrix high one at a time, and then reading the states of all 7 GPIO's that are attached to the keypad. For convenience, we'll call `gpio_get_all()`, then shift the result right by 9 (so that the state of GPIO 9 is in bit 0), and then mask with 0x7f. This way, we're left with a 7-bit number, where each bit in that number represents one of the pins of the keypad. The first four are attached to the rows, and the next 3 are attached to the columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "keypad = ((gpio_get_all() >> BASE_KEYPAD_PIN) & 0x7F) ;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that we set GPIO 9, and we are not presssing any keys. Then none of the column pins are shorted to the row pins, and they'd all remain pulled low. The bit associated with GPIO 9 will be high (since we set it high), but none of the others. So, when we scan the keypad, we get a value of 0b0000001, or 0x01. This is the scancode that corresponds to \"no press.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose instead that we set GPIO 9 high, and we press key 1. What value would we expect for the keypad? The bit associated with GPIO 9 will be high (since we set it high), and the bit associated with GPIO 13 will *also* be high, since pressing key 1 shorted it to GPIO 9. So, the binary value for `keypad` will be 0b0010001, or 0x11 in hex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that we had instead pressed 2. Then the bits of `keypad` associated with GPIO's 9 and 14 would be high. We would get a scancode of 0b0100001, or 0x21.\n",
    "\n",
    "And lastly, suppose that we had pressed 3. Then the bits of `keypad` associated with GPIO's 9 and 15 would be high. We would get a scancode of 0b1000001, or 0x41.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we had gotten any scancode *other than* 0x01, 0x11, 0x21, or 0x41, then that means the user had two keys pressed simultaneously. You could expand your keycodes to accomodate those cases, but for now we'll treat these as \"invalid presses.\"\n",
