    "This project implements the CAN 2.0 protocol using the PIO coprocessors on the RP2040. Features and specifications include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The CAN transmitter and receiver are implemented on separate ARM cores, separate PIO blocks, and utilize separate DMA channels. As such, they are *wholly* independent. The execution of one has no effect on the execution of the other.\n",
    "- The CAN transmitter supports arbitrary and variable payload lengths.\n",
    "- The CAN transmitter supports user-specified and run-time-modifiable idle-time between packets.\n",
    "- The CAN transmitter performs bus idle checks before transmission, and performs priority arbitration among nodes.\n",
    "- The CAN receiver re-synchronizes on every change of polarity in a received bitstring.\n",
    "- Each packet contains a checksum for error catching.\n",
    "- Each packet contains a flexible reserve bit for future utilization (routing? data requests?).\n",
    "- All aspects of the physical and packet layer are easily modifiable. (E.g. baud rate, packet rate, and packet structure).\n",
    "- Program code consumes ~27kB of flash memory\n",
    "- There is no measurable bit error rate with present configurations. \n",
    "- A test infrastructure is built to study bit error rate changes with changes to the physical layout of the bus. If errors manifest under different conditions (e.g. extremely long bus cables), then mitigating action can be taken (e.g. decreasing baud rate, or increasing idle time between packets).\n",

    "## System overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagrams below provide a high-level overview of the transmitter/receiver architecture. Each lives on separate cores and separate co-processors, so that there is no interaction whatsoever between them. In each of the diagrams, green arrows can be read as \"triggers,\" red arrows can be red as \"terminates,\" and black arrows indicate the flow of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In anticipation of the addition of sensors and other peripherals, user code is currently arranged using the threading library ProtoThreads. This makes user code highly modular and easy to augment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transmitter\n",
    "User code specifies packet information (arbitration ID, reserve byte value, payload length, and payload), and then calls a function called `sendPacket()`. This function computes a checksum over the user-specified data, and populates a complete packet (bit stuffing as it does so). Once the packet is assembled, this function then starts DMA channel 0, which shuffles the packet (16 bits at a time) over to the PIO state machine. This state machine is described in detail in a later section but, in short, it makes sure that the bus is idle, performs arbitration, and then communicates the payload. The PIO state machine sends an interrupt back to the CPU to indicate that it has finished with transmission and is ready for the next packet. In the meantime, user code may be calculating the next packet to send.\n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Receiver\n",
    "The receiving PIO program sits and waits for a start bit. When it sees one, it samples the bus once per bit time (re-synchronizing at each change in polarity). These data are autopushed 8 bits at a time to the array `rx_packet_stuffed.` When the PIO state machine encounters the end of frame bit sequence, it throws an interrupt to the CPU and stalls until the CPU clears that interrupt. The CPU enters an interrupt service routine, aborts the DMA channel which moves data from the PIO machine to the buffer, and calls the function `attemptPacketReceive( )`. This function un-bitstuffs the received packet into `rx_packet_unstuffed`, and computes a checksum over the data that it finds. The function will return 0 if it finds an arbitration identification mismatch, a checksum mismatch, or an out-of-bounds payload length. Otherwise, it will return a 1 to indicate a valid packet. The ISR may then perform some computation or routing on that received data, or signal a user thread to run. It then resets the write address for the DMA channel, restarts it, and clears the PIO interrupt to un-stall the state machine.\n",
