The 4N35 optoisolator completely isolates the MCU from the motor. The 1N4001 snubber diode provides a path to ground for reverse-polarity spikes coming off the motor, and the capacitor in parallel with the 1N4001 provides a path to ground for higher frequency noise. Some of the components in this circuit require some experimentation/trial and error. The resistor attached to the base of the 4N35 should be set for best falltime, probably ~1MOhm. The capacitor in parallel with the motor should be ceramic (electrolytics are too slow) and should start with a value ~0.1uF. If there is too much spike noise on the analog input, this value can be increased.\n",

The natural period is approximately the simple pendulum natural period. $T = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{L}{g}}$. Where L is the distance from the pivot to the motor, and g is gravitational acceleration. Using the DAC output to the scope, you can estimate the natural period. Also count the number of full cycles that the actual beam makes before it stops, and adjust the damping coefficient in the matlab code (DD) until the undriven pendulum matches the number of cycles. There are two versions of the matlab code. The first is a [simulator using radian measure](https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece4760/labs/f2019/lab4_beam_helicopter_1.m) (with some guesses about motor thrust scaling).

    "The ADC will probably be set up to measure the 10Kohm servo potentionmeter from zero volts to Vref, resulting in ADC units of 0 to 1023 representing the resistance range of 0 to 10kohm. According to the potientiometer datasheet, the 10K resistance range occurs over 340 degrees of rotation. The useful range of angles for this lab will be 180 degrees (hanging down to vertical above pivot point). The resistance range you can use is therefore `180/340*10Kohm=5.29K` ohm, so the raw ADC range will be about `5.29/10*1024=542` counts for 180 degrees rotation. If we set up the potentiometer to read about 520 ADC counts when the beam is hovering at horizontal position, then when hanging straight down the resistance will be about `520-271=249`, and when directly over the pivot point about 790."
