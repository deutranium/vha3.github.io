    "This code uses three PIO state machines (synchronized with one another via interrupts) to drive a VGA screen. The pixel data to draw on the screen is communicated to the PIO state machines through a DMA channel. All of this pixel data is stored in a global character array. So, in the application part of the code, the user need only modify the contents of that global character array and the changes will be automatically represented on the VGA screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of resources, this code uses PIO state machines 0, 1, and 2 on PIO instance 0. It uses all 32 available PIO instructions, and it uses 2 DMA channels (one to communicate data to the PIO system, and the other to reconfigure and restart the first). Only 3 bits are used to store color data for each pixel, which means that there are only 8 colors which can be drawn to the screen. Because only 3 bits are used to represent the color in each pixel, each character in the character array stores the data for 2 pixels (and 2 of the 8 bits are wasted). This gives a total memory usage of 1.536 kBytes.\n",

The protocol is described below, both textually and visually.\n",

    "The state machine for generating the 25MHz RGB signals is comparatively simple. After some intialization of counting registers, it zeroes the color pins until it receives the signal from the VSYNC state machine that a newline has been started *and* VSYNC is in active mode. When this condition is met, the RGB machine knows that it should clock out 640 pixels (i.e., one row). It does so by doing a pull from the TX FIFO (which is being fed pixel data from a DMA channel), putting the first 3 bits out to the RGB pins, waiting the appropriate number of cycles, putting the next 3 bits out, waiting the appropriate number of cycles, then jumping back and doing it again until it completes the row. Once the row is complete, it zeroes the outputs and waits again for the signal from the VSYNC machine. Note that this state machine runs at 125 MHz.\n",

    "The theory behind the Mandelbrot Set is covered on others of my project pages, so it isn't covered here. As a second demonstration, the RP2040 computes and renders the Mandelbrot Set. One a single core, it completed 79747133 complex iterations (fixed point) in 86.845272 sec. [Project Zip](./mandelbrot.zip).\n",

    "- The Hsync and Vsync PIO state machines should be started simultaneously. Because the RGB state machine is running at full speed, synchronization with the other two is not required.\n",
    "- The DMA read address trigger requires a *pointer to the address* of the start of the color array, **not** the address itself (this bug took a while to track down)\n",
    "- When attempting to read high-speed signals on the scope, note that there is some capacitance in the clip lead and some inductance in the grounding alligator cable. This capacitance/inductance can produce some ringing. To attenuate this ringing, remove the clip lead and grounding cable, retune the probe in this configuration, and ground the lead using a short length of wire. This reduces ringing considerably.\n",
    "- The read_addr register for DMA channel 0 expects a *pointer to the address of the start of the pixel array,* **not** the address itself."
