It draws a horizontal line at the user-specified target angle along with the current measured angle for comparison. VGA updates only take place at 40 Hz so that the screen is not re-drawn too quickly. In other words, if the VGA is acting like an oscilloscope, I've chosen an update rate such that the time/division is long enough to be useful.\n",

The ISR clears the interrupt flag, reads the ADC, shifts the ADC measurement right by 3 (according to the datasheet, only the most significant 9 of the 12 ADC bits are effective), computes the difference between the desired and measured helicopter angles, uses that difference to compute a PID control input to the DC motor, and stores that control input in a global variable. A DMA channel whisks this control input off to the CC register of the PWM channel to set the duty cycle, and a second DMA channel reconfigures and restarts the first.\n",

Some of the components in this circuit require some experimentation/trial and error. The resistor attached to the base of the 4N35 should be set for best falltime, probably ~1MOhm. The capacitor in parallel with the motor should be ceramic (electrolytics are too slow) and should start with a value ~0.1uF.
