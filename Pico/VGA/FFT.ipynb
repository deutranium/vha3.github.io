    "The code is structured as shown below. The ADC pacing timer is configured to gather samples at 10kHz, and to store those samples in the ADC FIFO (pre-shifted to 8 bits of significance). Whenever a sample appears in the ADC FIFO, the ADC's DREQ is asserted. DMA channel 2 is paced by the ADC DREQ, so that it automatically moves the ADC sample from the FIFO to a byte array. The DMA channel is configured to increment its write address so that it fills up each element of this 1024-element array with samples, at which point it signals to the C-code that it has finished. The C-code windows/copies this array to a local array, and then starts DMA channel 3. DMA channel 3 writes to the control registers of DMA channel 2 to reconfigure and restart it. While the next batch of samples is being gathered, the C code uses the local array to compute and display the FFT. It does so using the VGA PIO state machine described at length [here](./VGA.html).\n",

The ADC can be configured to one-shot sample mode, in which it will gather a single sample which gets stored in `RESULTS`. In free-running sampling mode, the ADC automatically starts new conversions at regular intervals, with the most recent conversion always availabel in `RESULT`. For IRQ or DMA-driven streaming, the ADC FIFO must be enabled. The FIFO is 4-entries long. If the FIFO is full when a sample completes, an error flag is set (`FCS.OVER`), the contents of the FIFO are not changed, and the conversion that completed when the FIFO was full is lost.\n",

This comparator compares the sampled voltage to the output of the internal DAC, the output from which is passed back to the successive approximation register. The SAR sets the most significant bit to 1, and evaluates the comparator output. If the sampled voltage is less than the DAC voltage, then the MSB is reset. Else it remains 1. The SAR then moves to the next-most significant bit and does the same. The resulting code is a digital approximation of the sampled voltage."

    "A series of steps are required to configure the DMA interface to the ADC. The C SDK makes these configurations quite simple, but even so care is required.\n",

    "1. If using a GPIO input (as opposed to the temperature sensor), prepare that GPIO for use with the ADC by disabling all digital functions. GPIO numbers 26, 27, 28, 29 are valid ADC GPIO pins.\n",

    "adc_gpio_init(uint gpio) ;\n",

This is accomplished by manipulating the RESETS_RESET_ADC_BITS and ADC_CS_EN_BITS. Then, wait for ADC_CS_READY_BITS to assert, which means that the staging for the ADC is complete. In the C sdk, this is all accomplished by calling:\n",
    "```c\n",
    "adc_init(void);\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. Select the ADC mux input. GPIO 26 is MUX 0, 27 is MUX 1, 28 MUX 2, 29 MUX3, and temperature sensor MUX 4. This is accomplished by manipulating the AINSEL bits. In the C sdk:\n",

    "Note that this will select a single ADC input. If round-robin sampling of a few inputs is desired, then different configuration is required. In particular, this would involve calling the `adc_set_round_robin()` function with the input mask.\n",
    "4. Configure the ADC FIFO. The ADC FIFO should be turned on, the DMA data request should be enabled, DREQ (and IRQ) should be asserted when at least 1 sample is present in the FIFO, the error bit should be disabled, and the ADC should be configured to shift each sample to 8 bits when pushing to the FIFO (so that we can DMA to a byte array).

    "5. Configure the pacing timer for the ADC. Divisor of 0 -> full speed. Free-running capture with the divider is equivalent to pressing the ADC_CS_START_ONCE button once per `div + 1` cycles (div not necessarily an integer). Each conversion takes 96 cycles, so in general you want a divider of 0 (hold down the button continuously) or > 95 (take samples less frequently than 96 cycle intervals). This is all timed by the 48 MHz ADC clock. For example, for a sample rate $F_s$, the setup is (48Mhz/$F_s$ - 1).\n",
