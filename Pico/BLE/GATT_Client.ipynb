    "## Purpose and intended audience\n",
    "\n",
    "This webpage documents this [GATT client demonstration](https://github.com/vha3/Hunter-Adams-RP2040-Demos/tree/master/Bluetooth/GATT_Client), which issues requests to the GATT server discussed on a [separate webpage](https://vanhunteradams.com/Pico/BLE/GATT_Server.html). As discussed on that webpage, a GATT client has no prior knowledge of the information stored on the server to which it connects, but it does have an understanding of the overall structure and layout of that server. This shared understanding of the *organization* of information in a GATT database (into services, characteristics, etc.) allows for the client to ask questions that the server understands. By asking a series of questions (\"which services do you offer?\", \"which characteristics are included in this service?\", etc.) the client can build a local model of the server with which it's communicating.\n",
    "\n",
    "This webpage describes the implementation of a client, demonstrated in the video below, that performs this querying process and that generates a command-line representation of the server's database using ASCII escape sequences. The client allows for the user to enable/disable notifications on characteristics, to issue write requests to characteristics that offer write permissions, and to issue read requests to the characteristics with read permissions. All of this is implemented using [BTstack](https://bluekitchen-gmbh.com), the Bluetooth stack implementation used by the Pi Pico W. The webpage first discusses the characteristic discovery process, and then the client user interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "These materials have been assembled for students in [ECE 4760](https://ece4760.github.io), though I hope that they might be useful to hobbyists building a Bluetooth interface among Pi Pico W devices."

    "## Server discovery process\n",
    "\n",
    "Our GATT client builds a local model of the GATT server by asking it a series of questions. This \"series of questions\" takes the form of a state machine. Before getting into the details of this state machine, let us have a brief conceptual discussion about the nature of the questions that the client will ask the server. Hopefully, this provides a conceptual handle that we can grab onto as we wade into the weeds of implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conceptual overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The client receives GAP advertisements from peripheral devices, and searches those advertisements for the presence of the service that it's looking for. Once it finds it, it connects to the peripheral and builds its local model of the server. This process is summarized below. Each of the items in this enumerated list will be elaborated upon later in this document. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Before connection\n",
    "1. **Does this GAP advertisement indicate that the peripheral device offers the service I'm looking for**? If yes, the client will initiate a connection process with the peripheral server. If not, it'll keep receiving and parsing GAP advertisements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### After connection\n",
    "1. **Do you offer the service that I'm looking for?**. The client queries the server to confirm that it offers the service that it's looking for. The server responds with the start/end handles and UUID of the service.\n",
    "2. **Please tell me every characteristic that this service contains.** The server will respond with a series of packets, each containing the start/end handles and UUID's of each characteristic in the specified service. This sequence ends with a packet that means \"that's all of them!\"\n",
    "3. **Please tell me every descriptor that each characteristic contains.** For the characteristic specified by the client, the server responds with a sequence of packets that contain the UUID and handle of each descriptor (e.g. client characteristic configuration and user description) for that characteristic. This sequence ends with a packet that means \"that's all of them!\". The client will then ask the same question about the next characteristic, until it's gotten through all characteristics.\n",
    "4. **Please tell me each characteristic's user description.** The client searches each characteristic's descriptors for the UUID associated with user description. It then queries the server for the value at the handle associated with that UUID in order to receive the character-array user description. The client repeats this for each characteristic until its gotten through all of them.\n",
    "5. **Please tell me each characteristic's value.** For the characteristic specified by the client, the server responds with that characteristic's value. The client will then ask the same question about the next characteristic, until it's gotten through all of them.\n",
    "6. **Please tell me the notification/indication status of each characteristic.**: The client searches each characteristic's descriptors for the UUID associated with characteristic configuration. If it finds it, it queries the server for the value associated with the client configuration characteristic. The client repeats this for each characteristic until its gotten through all of them.\n",
    "7. **Signal that all characteristics have been discovered. The local model of the server is complete.**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think about each item in this list as filling in gaps in the local version of the attribute database that the client is building. As discussed on the [GATT server page](https://vanhunteradams.com/Pico/BLE/GATT_Server.html), these attribute databases are well reprsented as tables. The *particular* attribute database that this GATT client will reconstruct is copied below from the [GATT server page](https://vanhunteradams.com/Pico/BLE/GATT_Server.html). As we move through each step above, I will include a version of this table that only includes the information that the client has been able to fill in to that point.\n",

    "There may be many peripheral devices sending GAP advertisements that the client will receive. The client chooses a peripheral for connection based on the contents of its advertising packet. In particular, it looks for an advertisement packet that contains the AD Type associated with a complete list of 16-bit service class UUID's, and that has the 16-bit UUID 0xFF10 associated with it. See [here](https://vanhunteradams.com/Pico/BLE/GATT_Server.html#Building-a-GAP-advertising-packet) for a description of the advertising packet construction on the server side, and see below for the code which we use to parse the received packets for the custom service. \n",

    "The context from which this function gets called is the HCI packet handler. This is the packet handler which manages events being emitted from the HCI layer of the Bluetooth stack, and this is where our discussion of the GATT client state machine begins. This packet handler manages events which occur *before* connection with a peripheral device. After the system boots up, a `BTSTACK_EVENT_STATE` event will be emitted and received by the packet handler. Upon receipt, the packet handler starts the client (initializes `state` to `TC_W4_SCAN_RESULT` and starts the GAP scanner). This packet handler then manages events associated with GAP advertising reports. As you can see, it confirms that the system is in the correct state, then calls the helper function above to parse the received advertisement for the custom service UUID. If it finds it, then it gathers the address of the sender, performs a state transition to `TC_W4_CONNECT`, stops the GAP scanner, and instantiates the connection process with the peripheral.\n",

The client calls `gatt_client_discover_primary_services_by_uuid128(handle_gatt_client_event, connection_handle, service_name);`. This is a request to the server to confirm that it offers the primary service specified by the 128-bit custom UUID that we pass in as the third argument. We will parse the server's response in our GATT packet handler, where the state machine continues. We also perform a state transition to `TC_W4_SERVICE_RESULT`.\n",

    "### Primary service discovery\n",
    "\n",
    "After we send a primary service discovery request to the server, the server will respond with the start/end handles and UUID of the service that we've asked about. This response comes in the form of a packet, which gets emitted to our GATT client event packet handler. This packet uses the BTstack API function `hci_event_packet_get_type(packet) ;` to extract the *type* of the packet, and then it implements a state machine based on that packet type.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full state machine is linked [here](https://github.com/vha3/Hunter-Adams-RP2040-Demos/blob/5837ed8c1799df085b58ed3549ac6253e9c861c0/Bluetooth/GATT_Client/client.c#L144). In order to avoid confusing this discussion with massive blocks of code, I'll only include the relevant pieces of this state machine inline in this document. In the snippet below, you'll note that the GATT client event packet handler is called by BTstack with the HCI channel identifier, a pointer to the packet (a character array), and the size of the packet. Before entering the state machine, the packet handler extracts the packet *type* from the packet. Then, it enters a state machine and takes an action based on its present state. Recall that the HCI packet handler placed us into state `TC_W4_SERVICE_RESULT`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GATT server will actually respond to our our service discovery request with *two* packets. The first is of type `GATT_EVENT_SERVICE_QUERY_RESULT`, and the packet payload contains the information of relevance about the primary service. We store this information in an object of type `gatt_client_service_t`, a BTstack structure with fields for the start/end handles of the service and its UUID. The second packet that we receive will be of type `GATT_EVENT_QUERY_COMPLETE`, which indicates that the server has finished the previous request. In this case, we confirm that we haven't had any ATT errors, turn on an LED, initialize some variables, and perform a state transition to `TC_W4_CHARACTERISTIC_RESULT`. Importantly, we *also* issue a second request to the server. This one is `gatt_client_discover_characteristics_for_service(handle_gatt_client_event, connection_handle, &server_service);`, which translates to \"please tell me all the characteristics that the primary service contains. \n",

This application is implemented by means of two Protothreads.
