    "This webpage documents [this GATT server example](https://github.com/vha3/Hunter-Adams-RP2040-Demos/tree/master/Bluetooth/GATT_Server), demonstrated in the video below. These materials have been assembled for students in [ECE 4760](https://ece4760.github.io) at Cornell, though I hope that they may be useful for hobbyists that wish to build a Bluetooth interface to their Pi Pico W projects. This webpage focuses primarily on the *implementation* of a GATT server, and only discusses the Bluetooth architecture to the extent that it adds clarity to description of the implementation. The same philosophy is applied to [BTstack](https://bluekitchen-gmbh.com/), the Bluetooth stack implementation which is used on the Pi Pico W. This webpage focuses more on how BTstack is *used*, rather than how it *works*.\n",

    "## A brief overview of the Bluetooth stack\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background information\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bluetooth Low Energy protocol stack is organized into layers. At the bottom of these layers is an antenna that communicates with analog communications circuits to modulate/demodulate 2.4GHz radio signals into digital symbols. Our application code lives at the top of this stack. **For context and completeness, I'll briefly describe each each protocol in the stack. Please note, however, that most people developing a Bluetooth application will interface only with the *top* layers (GAP and GATT) through an API that makes automatic use of the lower layers. Discussion of the lower layers, for our purposes, is only to introduce some vocabulary.**\n",
    "\n",
    "As illustrated in Fig. 1, these layers can be separated into three sections: Host, Controller, and Application. In the case of BTstack on the Pi Pico W, I've added a fourth layer between the application and controller called \"Packet Handlers.\" As we'll see, packet handlers are the mechanism by which our application interacts with the Bluetooth stack at runtime. Let us start at the bottom layer and work our way to the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "The physical layer of the Bluetooth stack contains the analog radio communication and modulation/demodulation circuits. It sends and receives data over the air using 2.4GHz GFSK-modulated radio transmissions. These analog transmissions are digitized by receiving devices and communicated to the next layer in the stack: the link layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The link layer is responsible for maintaining the state of the radio, structuring packets, computing checksums and computing encryption sequences. The link layer offers two types of channels to the radio: advertising and data. Devices that haven't connected to another device use the advertising channels to broadcast data, advertise themselves, and scan for other devices with which they may connect. The data channels are used by devices that *have* connected to exchange information. The link layer communicates data to both types of channels in packets with a defined structure. These packets include information about the address of the intended recipient, some metadata about the contents of the packet, the payload, and a checksum. This layer may include both custom software and custom hardware. It's a complicated piece of the Bluetooth stack which is often abstracted away from the developer, and with which we interact via the next layer: the host-controller interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Host-Controller Interface provides a standard interface through which a Host can interact with a Controller. This is useful because, as is the case with the Pi Pico W, it allows for the Host and Controller layers of the Bluetooth stack to live on *different* devices. This is a convenient place to split the stack via a standardized interface because all the layers *below* the HCI have hard real-time requirements while the layers *above* the HCI do not. It's often practical to separate the real-time constrained controller from the host, which can implement the protocol stack on a more advanced processor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The L2CAP layer talks to the HCI layer and has a couple of responsibilities. The first is fragmentation and recombination. The link layer packets have a strict size limit (generally 20 bytes of data payload per packet), but the upper layers may want to communicate (or receive) packets which are longer than this. The L2CAP layer receives packets from the upper layers and fragments them into manageable pieces for the lower layers. It also recombines the pieces of larger packets which it receives from lower layers before emitting the assembled message to the upper layers. In addition to fragmenting and recombining packets, the L2CAP layer performs multiplexing. It takes multiple protocols from the upper layers (mostly ATT and SMP) and puts them into the standard BLE packet format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Packets from the L2CAP layer will be emitted to either the Attribute Protocol (ATT) and Security Manager Protocol (SMP) layers. The SMP offers support for pairing, bonding, and encryption re-establishment between devices. The ATT layer implements a client/server protocol based on data organized into *attributes* (much more on that later). Each of these attributes includes the data of interest, and also some metadata about that data. This metadata includes things like a Universal Unique Identifier (UUID), access permissions, and a 16-bit handle that acts like the \"name\" or \"address\" of that attribute. ATT offers a large set of operations (error handling, read operations, write operations, server intiation, etc.) which are abstracted to an API by BTstack on the Pi Pico W. The *Generic Attribute Profile* builds a hierarchical data abstraction on top of ATT based on services and characteristics. More on those later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the Generic Access Profile controls device discovery and connection, security establishment, and general device interaction *outside* the protocol stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "To write a GATT server for the Pi Pico W, we will *mostly* interact with the GAP and GATT layers of this stack. Though some configuration of the lower levels will also be required.\n",

    "### Hardware utilization on RP2040\n",
    "\n",
    "The Raspberry Pi Pico W uses a CWY43439 Bluetooth and WiFi module, with which it communicates via two PIO state machines and two DMA channels. The C SDK uses the `claim` mechanism to obtain both the PIO state machines and the DMA channels. The SDK will attempt first to put the state machines on PIO block 1 and, if that isn't available, it'll put them on block 0. The CWY43439 implements the physical layer, link layer, and controller-side of the host controller interface. All other layers of the Bluetooth stack are implemented on the RP2040 by way of an RP2040 port of the third-party library [BTstack](https://bluekitchen-gmbh.com/). Please note that I did not contribute to BTstack (thank you, [Matthias Ringwald](https://github.com/mringwal)!), nor did I contribute to porting it to the RP2040 (thank you [Graham Sanderson](https://github.com/kilograham) and [Peter Harper](https://github.com/peterharperuk)!). If anyone more informed than me reads this and notices an error or misunderstanding, please let me know (vha3@cornell.edu) and I'll correct it."

    "## BTstack and the Bluetooth stack\n",
    "\n",
    "BTstack provides an infrastructure for interacting with all of the Host-layers of the Bluetooth stack from our application code, down to the Host-Controller Interface. Though BTstack includes an API for issuing commands to these lower layers, your application code will *probably* not need to do so. Instead, we'll make primary use of BTstack's API for higher-level profiles like GAP and GATT, which themselves make automatic use of those lower layers. That said, using BTstack does require some compile-time *configuration* of these lower layers. More on that in a bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "To our application code, BTstack looks like an asynchronous event generator. We can send it commands (all of which are non-blocking) which may, in turn, issue commands to the Bluetooth module. BTstack responds to those commands via asynchronous events, each of which emits a packet (a `char` array). The BTstack API includes a function that allows for us to determine the *type* of an emitted packet (\"what does the data in this packet represent?\") and a series of functions for parsing the packet based on its type. The code that we write manages these asynchronous events via packet handlers. Fig. 2, which comes from the [BTstack documentation](https://bluekitchen-gmbh.com/btstack/#architecture/), illustrates this general architecture.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "    <img align=\"center\" width=\"40%\" height=\"200\" src=\"BTSTACK.png\" alt='missing' />\n",
    "    <center><figcaption>Fig 2: BTstack architecture (figure from [1])</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of a GATT client, the commands that we send to BTstack include things like \"discover all characteristics in a particular service on a GATT server,\" \"read a characteristic value,\" or \"write this characteristic descriptor.\" Each of these commands is translated to some number of wireless transmissions to the GATT server. This server responds to these commands/queries and BTstack assembles those responses into packets which it asynchronously emits back to our client application. Our packet-handler implements a state machine which responds to the types of these emitted packet and to the data contained in that packet, thereby gaining an understanding of the organization and contents of the GATT server.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GATT server, on the other hand, merely responds to the requests that it receives from the GATT client (and possibly also sends some server-initiated updates to the client in the form of characteristic notifications). The GATT server organizes all data into a hierarchical database, the organization of which will be discussed in detail later on. Based on the brief description of GATT client/server roles above, you may notice that the GATT server is \"dumb\" compared to the GATT client. While the client must implement a relatively complicated series of queries to learn about the services and characteristics contained within a server, the server just does whatever its told to do by the client. This asymmetry is by design! At each layer of the Bluetooth stack, one of the devices is doing more \"work\" than the other device. GAP scanners do more work than advertisers, ATT clients do more work than servers, etc. This asymmetry allows for Bluetooth-equipped devices with more resources (e.g. phones, laptops, etc.) to offload some of the power/computationally-costly work from Bluetooth-equipped devices with less resources (sensors, small devices, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "This asymmetry also leads to a natural order in which to introduce the concepts associated with building a GATT server and client. We'll start with the server-side device and *then* discuss how to build a client device that is capable of communicating with it. This allows for us to become familiar with some concepts on the relatively-simple server side before deploying them on the relatively-complicated client side. *Also*, for many microcontrollers-oriented readers, it's probably the case that they *just* need to implement a server and needn't worry about the client, which will be running on a phone or computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm going to introduce these topics in the order that (for me, at least) is easiest to understand, which doesn't necessarily map directly to the order in which events occur when our server and client connect and communicate.  I may also discuss some pieces in isolation before later discussing how they integrate. Feedback on ways to improve clarity is welcome."

    "## The GATT database\n",
    "\n",
    "A GATT client doesn't know *anything* about the information stored on a server to which it connects. It must learn about the server's contents by asking it questions and listening to its answers. In order for this process to occur, the client and the server must \"speak the same language.\" They must agree on how the information on the server is *accessed.* This agreement allows for the client to ask questions which are comprehensible to the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps it stands to reason that, in order for the client to be able to pose meaningful questions to the server, the server must also store some metainformation *about* the data which it stores. Remember that a client doesn't know anything about the information on a server when it connects. Suppose a GATT server which stores information from a temperature sensor. If that server *only* stored the temperature measurement, the client would have no way of learning that the data represents temperature, that the data is read-only, or any other potentially-useful information (like units or sensor location). For that reason, the smallest unit of data which appears in a GATT server is an **attribute**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each attribute is composed of a *handle* (2 bytes), a *type* (2 or 16 bytes), and a *value* (0 to 512 bytes). Each handle represents the address of that particular attribute. We use an attribute's handle to access or refer to it. It's appropriate to think of this handle like a memory address (though it isn't the actual memory address of the attribute). The *type* of an attribute holds a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) for that attribute. There is a [whole library of UUID values](https://www.bluetooth.com/wp-content/uploads/Files/Specification/Assigned_Numbers.html) which are understood by Bluetooth client devices. This means, for instance, that we could assign our temperature sensor value the UUID associated with temperature and a connecting client would know, based on that UUID, that the data represents temperature. Though these UUID's are 128-bits long, there are 16-bit abbreviated UUID's for the \"standard\" attribute types. And finally, the attribute *value* holds the data itself. Note that this data needn't represent a measurement, it may instead be organizational information about the database, metadata about another attribute, etc. Each attribute also has associated *permissions*, which let the client know whether that attribute's value is readable, writeable, and whether authentication/authorization permissions are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Attribute Database\n",
    "\n",
    "The GATT server organizes all of these attributes into an attribute database, which is well-represented as a table. This database is, fundamentally, a flat structure. Each attribute in the database has its own handle, type, and value. However, the Attribute Profile hierarchichally organizes these attributes into logical groups. The GATT server organizes attributes into *services*, which themselves contain zero or more *characteristics*, which themselves contain zero or more *characteristic descriptors*. We can think of our table, which represents the attribute database, being organized into hierarchichal \"chunks.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of doing this is that it allows for us to generate standard groups of attributes which can be re-used across devices. A service is very analagous to a class in object-oriented programming. Each service contains zero or more characteristics, which are themselves containers for user data. For instance, and Environmental Sensing service may contain characteristics for temperature and humidity. Each of these characteristics contains at least two attributes: a declaration and a value. They may contain *additional* attributes in the form of characteristic descriptors, which provide additional context or metadata about that characteristic.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this becomes a bit clearer with a concrete example. Let us construct the following attribute database:\n",

    "## Implementing the GATT server\n",
    "\n",
    "With our database constructed, we must now implement the logic that allows for a GATT client to issue read and write requests to this database. Actually, we only need to implement *some* of this logic. BTstack will automatically handle read/write requests to all of the database characteristics that we did not specify as being `DYNAMIC`. In the case of the database above, these include the GAP device name and the GATT database hash. For all other characteristics, we must write the callback functions which specify what should be done when a GATT client issues a read or write request.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that the logic discussed in this section appears in the helper file [service_implementation.h](https://github.com/vha3/Hunter-Adams-RP2040-Demos/blob/master/Bluetooth/GATT_Server/GATT_Service/service_implementation.h).\n",
    "\n",
    "### A database struct\n",
    "\n",
    "As a matter of convenience, it's useful to assemble a struct which abstracts the dynamic characteristics of our database. This way, our read and write callback functions can perform operations on human-readable fields of this struct, rather than on slightly-obscure compiler-generated macros. When we initialize this struct, we'll assign the fields the values of these obscure macros *once* (more on that in a bit), and then our application code never needs to deal with them again. We can also use this struct to organize some of the other control and communication interfaces to our database.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first field in this struct is an object of type `hci_con_handle_t` called `con_handle`. The HCI connection handle is a 12-bit value that identifies the channel connection between two Bluetooth devices (or between separate applications on the same two devices). This value will be automatically provided to us in the LE connection complete event, we needn't worry about initializing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The subsequent 16 fields (all of the ones under comment-headers of the variety `Characteristic [X] information`) are the data structures, or pointers to data structures, which hold the actual data associated with our database. When the client makes a read or write request to any of our dynamic characteristics, our callback functions will ultimately access these variables (or the variables to which these point). Recall that the attributes associated with these dynamic characteristics did not have any value field, here's where those values live! These read/write requests specify the characteristic that they'd like to access using that characteristic's *handle*. The next set of fields (all of the ones under comment-headers of the variety `Characteristic [X] handles`) hold these handle values. During intialization, we will assign each of these fields its associated handle value, as generated by the Python GATT compiler.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the last four fields of this struct are objects of type `btstack_context_callback_registration_t`. We can use these to schedule callback functions for characteristics that our application modifies, and for which we'd like to send a notification to the client. These callback registrations allow for us to send Notifications and Indications independently from the main application. We can add the callback function to the BTstack run loop such that these notifications/indications are sent when it's possible to do so. We'll see this in more detail in just a bit. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our [service_implementation.h](https://github.com/vha3/Hunter-Adams-RP2040-Demos/blob/master/Bluetooth/GATT_Server/GATT_Service/service_implementation.h) file, we create [an object of this type](https://github.com/vha3/Hunter-Adams-RP2040-Demos/blob/3490e766c48b0fc623680eefca87e267382233ca/Bluetooth/GATT_Server/GATT_Service/service_implementation.h#L95). When we initialize our server, we'll associate the fields of this struct with the values generated by the Python compiler. More on that in the Initialization section.\n",

    "When a client issues a read request to one of our dynamic characteristics, that request gets emitted to a callback function. These callback functions are typedef'd in [add_db.h](https://github.com/bluekitchen/btstack/blob/master/src/ble/att_db.h#L144) and, [as you can see](https://github.com/bluekitchen/btstack/blob/2b49e57bd1fae85ac32ac1f41cdb7c794de335f6/src/ble/att_db.h#L144), they take a specified set of arguments. When we create our own callback functions, they should use this same set of arguments. Behind the scenes, when BTstack emits a read/write request to our read callback function, it will pass that function the hci connection handle associated with the request, the attribute handle (per our database, as discussed previously), an offset that specifies the start of the attribute *value*, a buffer and a buffer size. We will use this information to take whatever action we desire when a GATT client performs a read request to one of our dynamic characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "These actions will *mostly* make use of the [att database API](https://github.com/bluekitchen/btstack/blob/master/src/ble/att_db.h). As you can see below, our particular read callback function contains a series of conditionals. We check whether the attribute handle of the emitted attribute read request matches any of the attribute handles in our database struct. In the event that there is a match, we use a function fromt he att database API to read the associated value for that characteristic. In the event that the client issued a read request for a characteristic's value or user description, we use the `att_read_handle_blob` function in order to read an array of bytes back to the client. The arguments for this function include the address at which to start reading, the number of bytes to read, the offset from att_read_callback, the buffer and buffer size from att_read_callback. Alternatively, in the event that the client issued a read request for the characteristic configuration, we make use of `att_read_callback_handle_little_endian_16()`, which takes the value to be read, the offset from att_read_callback, the buffer from att_read_callback, and the buffer size from att_read_callback.\n",
    "\n",
    "In brief, the attribute handle tells use which attribute the client wants to read, and then the att database API from BTstack provides the mechanism for reading the value for the specified attribute.\n",

    "### Write callback\n",
    "\n",
    "Like the read callback, the write callback takes a [specified set of arguments](https://github.com/bluekitchen/btstack/blob/2b49e57bd1fae85ac32ac1f41cdb7c794de335f6/src/ble/att_db.h#L164). When the GATT client issues a write request to one of our dynamic characteristics, BTstack will emit that write request to our write callback function. It calls that function with arguments that include the hci connection handle, the handle of the attribute that is to be written, the transaction mode (we won't use this), the offset into the attribute value, a pointer to a buffer which contains the data to write, and the length of that buffer. It is up to us, in the callback function that we write, to update the specified attribute values in our database. This callback function also sends a notification to the client in the event that notifications are enabled for the particular characteristic being updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see below, the write callback is structurally similar to the read callback. It checks the handle of the attribute that is to be written, and takes different actions based on the handle value. It then uses the data in the buffer to update one of the fields of the database struct. This particular implementation represents characteristic values as char arrays. So, if the attribute being updated is a characteristic *value*, the callback function copies the contents of the buffer to the database array which holds that characteristic's value (being sure to null terminate it).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the event that the client is performing a write request to a characteristic *configuration* (i.e., turning notifications on/off), then the callback function simply copies the first to bytes of the buffer to the database struct field which represents that characteristic's notification status. As you can see in some of the conditionals below, this field is used to evaluate whether or not the server should send the client a notification that the characteristic value has updated. More on the details of this in a bit.\n",

    "The other thing you'll notice in some of the conditionals below is `PT_SEM_SAFE_SIGNAL(pt, &BLUETOOTH_READY) ;`. This is a semaphore to an application thread that takes an action based on a changed characteristic value. More on this application in a bit too.\n",

The function assigns the fields for user descriptions to the addresses of each of the global char arrays that hold these descriptions, and it assigns all the fields associated with attribute *handles* to the macros generated by the Python compiler.

    "## Advertising and connecting with Generic Access Profile (GAP)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before a client can connect with our server and exchange data over GATT, it must first be made aware of that server's existance, and then it must negotiate a connection with it. Both of these processes are facilitated by the Generic Access Profile (GAP). Let us have a brief discussion about GAP in general, and then we'll take a look at the particular GAP advertising packet used by this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some background on GAP\n",
    "\n",
    "GAP defines how devices discover and connect with one another. Within a BLE network, a device may adopt one of four possible GAP roles:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Broadcaster**: Just transmits data, to be received without acknowledgement by anyone who's listening.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observer**: Just receives data from broadcasting devices, without acknowledging receipt.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Central**: Connects with peripheral devices that it finds by means of their advertising packets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Peripheral**: Sends out advertising packets to allow for central devices to find it and subsequently connect with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with all the layers of the BLE protocol, there is an asymmetry present in these roles. It takes more resources to be a *central* than it does to be a *peripheral*. Much like the GATT server that just responds to requests from the GATT client, the GAP peripheral largely just responds to requests from a GAP central device. Our Pico W GATT server will be a GAP peripheral. It will advertise itself to any listening central devices (e.g. a phone running LightBlue, or another Pico W running a GATT client), and then it will accept a connection from that central device. Once connected, the two exchange data via GATT.\n",
    "\n",
    "The peripheral advertises itself by means of *advertising packets*. These packets contain up to 31 bytes of data (if scan request/response is enabled this could be doubled to 62 bytes), and these data contain information for listening central and observer devices. Broadcasting devices may *only* contain data (e.g. temperature) and some metadata about that data. A peripheral's advertising packet will include information about its *discoverability*, among other things. Much like the attribute database, each of these data structures is specified by a UUID.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often the case that the first data byte of a peripheral advertising packet is the Flags AD Type, which specifies the discoverability of the advertising peripheral. A peripheral may advertise itself to be in general-discoverable mode, which means that the peripheral will remain discoverable for as long as necessary. The peripheral may alternatively advertise itself as being in limited discoverable mode, which indicates that it will only be discoverable for a short amount of time (generally, central devices like phones will place these devices at the top of lists of discovered Bluetooth devices to facilitate quick connection by the user). If you've used a device with a \"press to connect\" button, that button likely put the device into limited discoverable mode. Finally, the peripheral may advertise itself as non-discoverable. This tells listening devices that theymay not report the presence of the peripheral or perform any inquiries about it. Such a device could still send broadcast packets that contain a warning to receiving devices not to follow-up. We will place our device in general discoverable mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the advertising packet might look different for different devices. Some common AD types that a packet might include are the device's local name (for population on lists of discovered devices), its appearance (so that phones and computers can associate icons with the device), its tx power level (so that, by comparing with the rx power level, the central device can generate an estimate of the distance to the peripheral), a complete or partial list of GATT services offered by the device, recommendations about connetion interval ranges for which the peripheral is best suited, a service solicitation (we might see this from an advertising client looking for a particular type of server), service data, or manufacturer-specific data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each advertising GAP device also *must* contain a GAP service in its GATT server. Any connected device may read this service without any security requirements, and it offers information about the device name, its appearance, and possibly some preferred connection parameter information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building a GAP advertising packet\n",
    "\n",
    "Our GATT server's advertising packet lives in [gap_config.h](https://github.com/vha3/Hunter-Adams-RP2040-Demos/blob/master/Bluetooth/GATT_Server/GAP_Advertisement/gap_config.h), and is copied below. You can see that each AD Type is in its own line for readability. Each of these lines starts with a byte that represents the length of the associated AD Type. This length field is followed by the UUID (represented as a BTstack-provided macro) of the AD Type, and then followed by the data associated with that AD Type.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for instance, the first AD Type in our advertising packet is the Flags AD. This AD Type is 2 bytes long, the first byte is the UUID for the Flags AD, and the second byte is the value. Our chosen value (0x06) indicates to listening devices that our device is general discoverable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second AD Type is 5 bytes in length, and represents the local name of the advertising device (`BLUETOOTH_DATA_TYPE_COMPLETE_LOCAL_NAME`). The data associated with this AD Type is the local name of the device in ASCII. In our case, this is \"Pico.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The final AD Type is a complete list of 16-bit service class UUID's. The data associated with this AD Type is the 16-bit version of the UUID for the custom service that we've built for our GATT server. The Pico-based GATT client (discussed later) will filter on this field in order to connect with servers that offer the services that it's looking for. (Please note that BTstack does offer an API for assembling this packet using a series of function calls. It seemed clearer for purposes of this document to write it out explicitly).\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "// Flag for general discoverability\n",
    "#define APP_AD_FLAGS 0x06\n",
    "\n",
    "// GAP data packet (must not exceed 32 bytes)\n",

    "    0x03, BLUETOOTH_DATA_TYPE_COMPLETE_LIST_OF_16_BIT_SERVICE_CLASS_UUIDS, 0x10, 0xFF,\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### A packet handler for setting up and starting GAP advertisements\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code associated with the [Instantiating the server](#Instantiating-the-server) section above, you'll see the following two lines:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "// inform about BTstack state\n",
    "hci_event_callback_registration.callback = &packet_handler;\n",
    "hci_add_event_handler(&hci_event_callback_registration);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These two lines associate a custom packet handler for HCI events that BTstack emits. That custom packet handler is also implemented in [gap_config.h](https://github.com/vha3/Hunter-Adams-RP2040-Demos/blob/master/Bluetooth/GATT_Server/GAP_Advertisement/gap_config.h), and it's copied below. You can see that this packet handler is called with the packet type and a pointer to a char array which contains the received packet (along with a parameter that represents the size of this array). The packet handler below uses this information to setup and start GAP advertisements when our system boots up.\n",
    "\n",
    "The handler first confirms that the packet type is indeed an HCI_EVENT_PACKET, and then it extracts the event type from the packet. The first event that the system emits is `BTSTACK_EVENT_STATE`. When a packet of this type is received, the packet handler confirms that the system has booted properly and then it configures and starts the GAP advertisements. In particular, it associates a randomly generated local address with our device and sets the advertising interval to 800 ms. It then sets the advertising type to 0. There exist four different advertising types:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Connectable undirected**: used for general advertising, allows for any other device to connect. *This is the type that we're using*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Connectable directed**: Requests for a *particular* peer device (with a known address) to connect.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scannable undirected**: Broadcasts advertising data to active scanners.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nonconnectable undirected**: Just broadcasts advertising data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next argument specifies the direct address type as 0 (public device address), and sets the direct address to all zeroes (we aren't using connecteable directed advertising, so this field won't be used). The penultimate argument is the channel map, which specifies which of the three advertising channels should be used. And the final argument is the filter policy, which indicates whether or not an address whitelist is being used to filter advertising packets that may be received in response to those we send out. By setting this argument to zero, we tell BTstack that we aren't using a whitelist, we'll accept packets from anybody.\n",
    "\n",
    "The packet handler then confirms that the length of the advertising packet is less than 31 bytes, and then it sets the advertising data to the char array discussed previously. Finally, it enables GAP advertisements.

    "## An application that uses this server\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to demonstrate this GATT server, I have assembled a [simple application](https://github.com/vha3/Hunter-Adams-RP2040-Demos/blob/master/Bluetooth/GATT_Server/server_demo.c). This application renders the contents of the GATT database on a [VGA display](https://vanhunteradams.com/Pico/VGA/VGA.html), and implements a serial interface through which the user can update some of the characteristics in that database. A connecting GATT client (be it a phone running LightBlue, or another Pi Pico W) can issue read/write requests for each of these notifications, and toggle notifications on/off.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example application includes three [Protothreads](https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece4760/RP2040/C_SDK_protothreads/index_Protothreads.html) and a timer interrupt running at 50kHz. [The timer interrupt](https://github.com/vha3/Hunter-Adams-RP2040-Demos/blob/3490e766c48b0fc623680eefca87e267382233ca/Bluetooth/GATT_Server/server_demo.c#L116) implements a [Direct Digital Synthesis](https://vanhunteradams.com/DDS/DDS.html) sine-wave generator with a frequency that is specified by characteristic B in the GATT server. By changing the value of this characteristic, the GATT client can adjust the frequency of the sine wave that gets communicated to an SPI DAC and, ultimately, to a set of speakers.\n",
    "\n",
    "[One of the three protothreads](https://github.com/vha3/Hunter-Adams-RP2040-Demos/blob/3490e766c48b0fc623680eefca87e267382233ca/Bluetooth/GATT_Server/server_demo.c#L140) simply runs at 2Hz, incrementing the value of Characteristic A each time it runs and updating the value of the characteristic on the VGA display. If the client has enabled notifications, then it will see Characteristic A increment each time this thread runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Another thread](https://github.com/vha3/Hunter-Adams-RP2040-Demos/blob/3490e766c48b0fc623680eefca87e267382233ca/Bluetooth/GATT_Server/server_demo.c#L170) is [semaphore-signalled](https://github.com/vha3/Hunter-Adams-RP2040-Demos/blob/3490e766c48b0fc623680eefca87e267382233ca/Bluetooth/GATT_Server/GATT_Service/service_implementation.h#L232) by our write callback function. Each time the GATT client updates a characteristic, this thread will be signalled to run. When it runs, it simply updates the values of all characteristics on the VGA display.\n",
    "\n",
    "[The final thread](https://github.com/vha3/Hunter-Adams-RP2040-Demos/blob/3490e766c48b0fc623680eefca87e267382233ca/Bluetooth/GATT_Server/server_demo.c#L281) implements a serial user interface that allows for a user to modify the value of Characteristic C. If the GATT client has notifications enabled, then it will see this value change each time the user modifies it.\n",
