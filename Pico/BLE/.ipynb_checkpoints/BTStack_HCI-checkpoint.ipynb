    "This webpage attempts to offer a mental model for the HCI layer of BTstack, the implementation of the Bluetooth stack which is used for the Raspberry Pi Pico W. Please note that I did not contribute to BTstack (thank you, [Matthias Ringwald!](https://github.com/mringwal)), nor did I contribute to porting it to the RP2040 (thank you [Graham Sanderson](https://github.com/kilograham) and [Peter Harper](https://github.com/peterharperuk)!). If anyone more informed than me reads this and notices an error or misunderstanding, please let me know (vha3@cornell.edu) and I'll correct it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first of what will be a handful of webpages. This webpage investigates what happens when we call `cyw43_arch_init()` on the RP2040. This investigation reveals how the device-agnostic BTstack code gets associated with the RP2040-specific code which ports it to the RP2040. It also reveals the mechanisms which underly the high-level `async` library upon which the RP2040 port of BTstack is assembled. It reveals which hardware resources get used by BTstack (two DMA channels, two PIO state machines, one hardware alarm, and an ARM user interrupt) and the logical organization of the low-level HCI layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coming webpages will move up the layers of abstraction to investigate the L2CAP layer, security manager, etc. Everything on this webpage comes from careful reading of the [`pico-examples/pico_w/bt/standalone`](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/tree/master/pico_w/bt/standalone) example from the [`pico-examples`](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples) repository.

    "Last time we paused, our `async_context` contained two `when_pending_workers` (`cyw43_poll_worker` and `bstack_processing_worker`). The `do_work` fields of *both* of these workers lead to `btstack_work_pending`. This function goes through the linked lists of data sources, callbacks, and timer objects to run the functions pointed to by their `process` field, if that particular item is ready to be run. Previously, we didn't have any data sources, callbacks, or timers in any of those lists. Now we have a data source!\n",

This function performs a low-level transaction with the CYW43 (an SPI transaction, as we'll see) and stores the received packet in a buffer called `hci_packet_with_pre_buffer`. It then uses that buffer as an argument to `hci_transport_cyw43_packet_handler`, which points to the `packet_handler` function in `hci.c` which implements the bluetooth stack.\n",

The `do_work` field of each of our workers points ultimately to `btstack_work_pending`. This function will then go through each data source and run the function pointed to by its `process` field. We've now added the HCI transport layer as a data source, and its `process` function gathers a packet from the CYW43 over an SPI channel, and then calls a function which takes various actions based on that packet which implement the bluetooth stack. One of the things that this function (`packet_handler`) does is call `hci_emit_event`, which then runs each of the callback functions in `hci_stack->event_handlers`.\n",
