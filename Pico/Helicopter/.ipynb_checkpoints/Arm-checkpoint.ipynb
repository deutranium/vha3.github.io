    "6. The potentiometer mounting hold on the bracket is slightly too small for the potentiometer sleeve. You will need to use the rat-tail (round) file to enlarge the hole.\n",
    "7. When attaching the potentiometer to the mounting bracket, be sure that the locating pin (see data sheet) is in the appropriate sheet metal slot. The shaft on these potentiometers is freely rotating. Therefore, when attaching the beam to the potentiometer shaft you need to check the whole range of shaft motion for continuous resistance. I suggest adjusting the pot to 1/2 full resistance, then attach the knob to the potentiometer shaft with the wooden beam held in the horizontal position.<br>\n",
