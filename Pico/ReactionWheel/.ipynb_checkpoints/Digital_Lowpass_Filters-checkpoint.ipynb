    "In the [Reaction wheel inverted pendulum laboratory assignment](./ReactionWheel.html), you are asked to display the accelerometer angle, gyro angle, complementary angle, and PID-computed control input on the VGA display. In the image below, the bottom plot shows angles (accelerometer in white, gyro in red, complementary in green), and the top plot shows the control input. Please note that the motor was *off* when I took this image (I simply moved the arm back and forth by hand), which is why there is so little noise on the accelerometer angles.\n",

    "If you use a very large derivitive term in the PID controller to stabilize the oscillations, you may need to lowpass filter the motor signal to display on the scope. Consider using a first order IIR, digital lowpass, with a time constant of about 64 PWM samples, given by:<br><br>\n",
