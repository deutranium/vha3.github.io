    "## Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Get the complementary filter running!\n",
    "You cannot build a controller with a measurement of the arm's tilt angle. Start by implementing a [complementary filter](./Complementary_Filters.html) of the accelerometer and gyroscope measurements running to estimate angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Implement proportional control\n",
    "The proportional term of the PID controller sets the voltage (or PWM duty cycle) applied to the motor by scaling the error between the estimated tilt angle (from the complementary filter) and the desired tilt angle (0 degrees) by a constant $K_p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are starting from the [PWM demo](https://github.com/vha3/Hunter-Adams-RP2040-Demos/tree/master/Lab_3/PWM_Demo) in the course demo code repository, then the PWM channel can be assigned a duty cycle in the range [0, 5000]. We want for the controller to work over a range of +/- 3-4 degrees off the vertical, so start with a proportional gain of approximately 1500. Here is some pseudocode:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "// Compute the error\n",
    "error = (desired_angle - complementary_angle) ;\n",
    "\n",
    "// Compute duty cycle with P controller\n",
    "duty_cycle = Kp * error ; \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Use your hand to gently move the pendulum back and forth. Do you see the reaction wheel speed increase in one direction when you move the arm right, and in the other direction when you move it left? Do you feel the arm fighting against your rotation, or trying to make the arm rotate faster? If it feels like the wheel is trying to pull the arm faster, then switch the sign on $K_p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your calculation of the duty cycle may yield a negative number. Remember that the sign of the duty cycle just indicates the *direction* that the motor should turn. In other words, the sign tells you which of the two PWM channels which drive the H-bridge you should command, and which you should set to zero.\n",

    "### 3. Add integral control\n",

    "if (error_accumulation<(-Imax)) error_accumulation=-Imax ;\n",
    "\n",
    "// Compute duty cycle with PI controller\n",
    "duty_cycle = (Kp * error) + (Ki * error_accumulation) ; \n",
