    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "When the James Webb Space Telescope (or nearly any other modern spacecraft, for that matter) wants to change its orientation, how does it do so? It's not obvious how to turn something around in space where there's nothing (not even air) to push against. You might consider using thrusters, but those come at a cost! They require propellant. Propellant weighs a lot, and you can run out of it! A thruster shoots material into space when it fires, which can interfere with sensitive instrumentation. Furthermore, thruster fires tend to be impulsive in nature, which can excite vibrational modes in the spacecraft and don't allow for the ultra-precise control required to point at a distant star. Fortunately, thrusters aren't the only option for changing a spacecraft's orientation!\n",
    "\n",
    "For changing the *orbit* of a spacecraft, you must have an external force (like a thruster) acting on the spacecraft. But to change the *orientation* of a spacecraft, we just need a torque! That torque *might* come from a thruster exerting a force, since $\\bf{\\tau} = \\bf{F} \\times \\bf{r}$, but it can also come from a change in angular momentum, since $\\tau = \\frac{d \\bf{L}}{dt}$. A spacecraft can change its orientation by *storing* angular momentum in an internal device, and then *exchanging* angular momentum between that device and the spacecraft body. Often, that device is a [reaction wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_wheel#James_Webb_Space_Telescope).\n",
    "\n",
    "A reaction wheel is a heavy, spinning disc rigidly mounted inside the spacecraft. The reaction wheel + spacecraft is a closed system which must conserve angular momentum. So, if we make the reaction wheel spin slightly faster in the clockwise direction, the spacecraft body will compensate by spinning in the counterclockwise direction. Point a reaction wheel in each direction, and you've got 3-axis control! If you care to dive into the physics, please see [here](https://vanhunteradams.com/5160/ADCS/Supplements/ADCS.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will use a PID controller to modulate the speed of a reaction wheel at the end of an inverted pendulum. The torque that the reaction wheel exerts on the pendulum will balance it. In order for this to work, we must close the loop around a measurement of the pendulum angle. This angle will be estimated using a complementary filter of accelerometer and gyroscope measurements from an IMU.\n",
