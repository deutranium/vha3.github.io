    "This project was meant to provide an objective thru which to build understanding of DMA and SPI channels on the RP2040. For this project, I chained two DMA channels. One of those channels is triggered by a timer which is configured to overflow at audio-rate ($\\approx 44$ kHz). This channel moves data from a sine table to the SPI transmit buffer. The SPI channel is configured to automatically transmit any new data which appears in its transmit buffer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other DMA channel is chained to the first. When the first DMA channel finishes traversing the sine table, it triggers the second channel. This channel writes to the *control registers* of the first DMA channel. In particular, it writes to the `AL3_TRANS_COUNT_TRIG` register associated with the other DMA channel. This control register sets the number of transactions that the first DMA channel should execute (the length of the sine table). Because it is a trigger register, writing any non-zero value to this register automatically triggers the DMA channel to start. So, these two channels ping-pong off one another. The first finishes and triggers the second, the second writes to the control/trigger register of the first. The consequence is a persistent sine wave output from the DAC, with no code executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the code is provided in a listing in the first section of this page. The rest of the page walks through the C source file from top to bottom, explaining each line of code. Lastly, I've included some plots output plots from the oscilloscope and compared the measured output frequency to the expected output frequency. The two agree."

The sine table will contain amplitudes for a single period of a sine wave, `sine_table_size` sets the number of samples that we will store. Note that, for reasons that will become apparent farther down in the code, it is convenient to make the length of this table a power of two.\n",
    "\n",
    "We next declare two arrays with lengths equal to `sine_table_size`. We will populate these arrays in `main()`, but note that `raw_sin` is an array of `ints` and `DAC_data` is an array of `unsigned shorts`. As the names suggest, we will store raw sine wave amplitudes in `raw_sin`, and we will store the formatted bits that will be send to the DAC through the SPI channel in `DAC_data`. As described in the DAC datasheet, the DAC expects 16-bit packets through the SPI channel. The most significant 4 of these bits are configuration and control bits, and the least significant 12 are data (i.e. the 12-bit number in the range [0, 4096] that we want for the DAC to convert to a voltage). So, each element in the `DAC_data` array will contain a formatted version of the corresponding element in the `raw_sin` array. In particular, the sine wave amplitudes will be truncated to 12 bits, and the DAC control bits will be masked to the top 4 bits of each element in the array. The result will be that each element in the `DAC_data` array will be an `unsigned short`, the top 4 bits of which are DAC control bits, and the bottom 12 bits of which are data.\n",

    "Furthermore, note that we have aligned the `DAC_data` array in memory. The reason for this will become obvious later in the code, but this is so that we can use the `channel_config_set_ring` option for the DMA channel, so that it will wrap its read address at the end of the array and start reading again at the beginning. For this to work, we need a naturally aligned array.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next line of code sets the top 4 DAC configuration bits. You can read about these configuration bits in the DAC datasheet, but note that the bottom 12 bits of `DAC_config_chan_A` are all 0's. In `main()`, we will mask the DAC data into these bottom 12 bits, maintaining the top 4 control bits.\n",

Note that the numbers in these lines of code correspond to GPIO port number and *not* to pin numbers. See the GPIO port numbers in the image below. Note also that these pins are not chosen arbitrarily. We've chosen a particular set of GPIO ports which are all associated with the same SPI channel (SPI0), and named each according to its available function on that SPI channel (MISO/RX, MOSI/TX, CS, SCK). We could have chosen different GPIO ports for each of these functions, but not arbitrary ports, only those with the same signals mapped to them. The final line in this chunk specifies the SPI channel which we are using, which is `spi0`. `spi0` is declared in the `spi.h` header file (`pico-sdk\\src\\rp2_common\\hardware_spi\\include\\hardware\\spi.h`).\n",
