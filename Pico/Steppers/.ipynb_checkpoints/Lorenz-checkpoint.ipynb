It first pulls the commanded number of steps from the FIFO to the OSR, and then moves that value from the OSR to the X scratch register. In `countloop`, the state machine signals to the pulse length state machine to start a new pulse, waits for the pulse length state machine to signal that it has started that pulse, and then decrements X. It will continue to signal the pulse length state machine until X is zero, at which point it will send an interrupt to the CPU that all commanded steps have been executed. The state machine waits for the CPU to clear this interrupt, and then pulls a new commanded number of steps.\n",

Note that these DMA channels send a 32-bit value to the counter state machines. In principle, this means that a motor could be commanded to execute $2^{32}$ steps which, at the motor's maximum speed, would take ~2 days. For applications that required continuous rotation, the interrupt service routine entered after executing all commanded steps would command a new set of steps."

    "#### Wait time is **not** velocity\n",
    "\n",
    "A point that, in retrospect, should have been obvious. This cost me about half a day of debugging. Note that the velocity of the motor (in RPM, or similar units) is *not* directly proportional to the length of the pulse in cycles. It is *inversely proportional!* My DDS-generated circles were really weird and squared-off until I realized this.\n",

    "#### Same PIO state machines loaded on each PIO block\n",
    "\n",
    "You can load an identical state machine onto each PIO block, or multiple times into different state machines in the same PIO block. Not mysterious, but this is the first I've experimented with that.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Maximum motor speed experimentally determined\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the maximum speed of the motor (the minimum number of cycles that each pulse could last and the motor would still turn), I simply reduced the value until the motor stopped turning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### If could reduce to 2 state machines, could have 4 motors or 2 motors + VGA\n",
    "\n",
    "This driver is split into 3 state machines for each motor so that the user could, in the application, dynamically update the number of steps, speed, and direction of the motor. If an application did not require this much control (contant motor speed, for example), then one may be able to reduce the number of state machines to 2. If you did *that*, then you could fit the drivers for both motors on one PIO block. This could either allow you to control 4 motors simultaneously *or* use the other PIO block to do something like [drive the VGA display](https://vha3.github.io/Pico/VGA/VGA.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Slop in the etch a sketch mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "It was quite difficult to make the etch a sketch draw a perfect circle because of slop in the mechanism. When the knob slows and reverses direction, it spins through a nonzero angle before the mechanism catches and starts moving the trace again. This small angle results in a flat edge on the circle. A solution is to have the motor pop quickly through a few steps when it reverses directions, but this is not entirely deterministic. Doing this made the circles look nicer, but it also made them slightly miss perfectly closing and retracing themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### GPIO's for PIO must be sequential\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple datasheet point. If you are specifying the pins associated with an `out` instruction, then those GPIO pins are assumed to be sequential.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Autopulling is easy and worth it\n",
    "\n",
    "Very easy to setup, saves an instruction."
