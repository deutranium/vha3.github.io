    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective for this project was to implement a UDP transmitter for use on the RP2040 that would consume *zero* CPU time. The system described on this webpage is implemented with 3 PIO state machines, 12 DMA channels, and 1 PWM channel. It generates an NLP, performs packet checksum calculations, and performs packet transactions with no CPU interaction beyond specifying the data which should be transmitted. It uses the unique ID for the flash chip to generate a MAC address for the RP2040.\n",
    "\n",
    "For applications which don't require additional DMA channels (since they're all consumed by the UDP machine described below), the exclusive use of peripherals for UDP transactions should make for particularly simple integration into application code, and maximizes the data rate out of the RP2040. This was constructed as a piece of course infrastructure for [ECE 4760](https://ece4760.github.io) at Cornell, for use in student projects.\n",

    "\n",
    "Though the UDP transmitter described on this webpage supports dynamic modification of the source and destination addresses for transactions, it is optimized for static source address, destination address, and payload size. The user configures these parameters, and the only portion of the packet which is modified by the user application code during runtime is the UDP data (which can be done as quickly as the system can modify the values in an array). The user application code modifies this data, and starts DMA channel 2. This initiates a sequence of DMA events that will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Stop the PWM channel, so that no normal link pulses are generated during the transaction.\n",
    "2. Zero the PWM counter, so that it counts back up from zero when re-enabled after the transaction (like a watchdog)\n",
    "3. Initializes the DMA sniffer data register.\n",
    "4. Resets the read pointer for the DMA channel which will send the UDP Ethernet packet to PIO state machine 0.\n",
    "5. Sends the preamble/SFD to PIO state machine 0, which serializes it out to the TX+ and TX- pins.\n",
    "6. Sends the UDP Ethernet packet to PIO state machine 0, which serializes it out to the TX+/TX- pins. Note that the DMA sniffer is attached to this channel! So the Ethernet checksum is automatically computed during this transaction, and stored in the `sniffer data` register.\n",
    "7. Moves the checksum (32 bits) to a buffer character array.\n",
    "8. Sends this checksum character array to PIO state machine 0, which serializes it out to PIO state machine 0.\n",
    "9. Sends a delay time to PIO state machine 2, which will wait for the specified amount of time (for the checksum transaction to complete), and then generate the TP_IDL signal. This PIO state machine will also generate an interrupt to signal to the processors that the transaction is complete.\n",
    "10. Re-enables the PWM channel to resume generating the normal link pulse.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sequence of events is illustrated in the diagram below. Each of the red arrows reads as \"chains to.\" So, you can follow the sequence of events by following the red arrows. Note that DMA channels 0 and 1, which are responsible for interacting with the PIO state machine which generates the normal link pulse, are independent from the other channels. They only see the `DREQ` generated by the PWM channel. So, this PWM channel is the sole mechanism for interaction between the NLP state machine and the UDP ethernet state machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of all this DMA footwork is that the ethernet transactions are *completely non-blocking*. For long payloads, this is a really nice feature! User application code can generate the next packet (gather sensor data, perform computations, etc.) while the previous packet is being transmitted. This maximizes the data rate out of the RP2040.\n",

However, we should have this timer be *reset* every time we finish sending a packet.\n",
