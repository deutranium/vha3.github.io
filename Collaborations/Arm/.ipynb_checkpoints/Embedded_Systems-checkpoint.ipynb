    "#### Lesson 1: Course introduction\n",
    "What is a microcontroller?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A microcontroller is a small computer on a single integrated circuit that is designed to control specific functions or systems. The appropriate mental model for a microcontroller is *different* than that for a personal computer on which you read emails or watch movies. A microcontroller includes a processor, but often also includes a collection of *other* hardware peripherals with which that processor communicates, like memory for storing informaiton, or input/output pins for interfacing with sensors and other devices. Microcontrollers are an entire tool*kit* rather than a singular tool, and a good microcontroller programmer thinks carefully about how best to use the various tools in that kit to accomplish a specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where do we find microcontrollers?\n",
    "\n",
    "- We find microcontrollers in places where we need a relatively simple task carried out *extremely* reliably, often subject to strict timing requirements. We find them communicating with sensors in robots and cars. We find them controlling motors in airplanes and medical equipment. We find them in keyfobs, security systems, spaceships, rockets, race cars, and rovers. In the future, we may even find them in brains and bodies. They are one of *the* foundational technologies for maintaining industrialized society.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Because microcontrollers are increasingly present in nearly every major industrial area, it is essential to learn how do develop with them as parts of larger devices and even systems of devices, programs, people, the environment, etc. Hence, this course will also introduce you to systems engineering concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes embedded systems engineering and programming interesting?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Programs for microcontrollers are *different* than those for personal computers in that a program not only describes a sequence of instructions for the processor, but also configures and controls those *hardware peripherals* with which the processor communicates. A microcontroller is also different from a personal computer in that it interfaces with the outside world. This makes debugging an embedded system *way* different than debugging a computer program on a PC. A bug in an embedded system may stem from software (an error in one's code), or it may be a consequence of physics (are my motor control lines generating electromagnetic fields which are inducing noise on my sensor measurements?). This makes debugging a full sensory experience. We parse our code, but we also use instrumentation to measure voltages, we use our nose to smell for burning, we use our hands to make connections among components, and we sometimes even use our ears to deduce what is happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Programming a microcontroller is also different from programming a personal computer in that (in my biased opinion) it is way more fun. A microcontroller forces the engineer to achieve objectives subject to *constraints*. You only have so much memory to spend. You only have so many cycles. You may only have so much power. These constraints require *cleverness*, and they require thinking deeply about about the problem that you're trying to solve and the device that you're using to solve it. Debugging these systems puts you in conversation with physics in a way that is very different than that which you get from a textbook, and that is deeply interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "For what role will this course prepare you?\n",
    "\n",
    "- This course does not aim to make you an expert in embedded systems. Instead, it aims to help you work with embedded systems experts by familiarizing you with core concepts from embedded systems, and by describing *the way that embedded systems engineers think about problems*. The best way to introduce all of these concepts is by building something, and so this course will be structured around a project. In particular, we will make a digital theremin - a musical instrument that you'll play without touching.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is systems engineering and why should I be interested in it?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Systems Engineering encompasses and formalizes many of the best design and organizational practices of the world’s leading technology companies and organizations. In fact, In a special meeting of numerous top Cornell alumni and industry contacts, Systems Engineering was ranked as the #1 skills set that all engineers should have – and not just to help them to have a good career start, but be able to continue to make a valuable difference in their jobs ten years from now. It may be part of the reason why so many top companies are willing to pay for their employees to come to Cornell.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Normally only taught at the graduate level, this course can offer undergrads and graduate students alike the opportunity to apply (not just learn about) some fundamental systems engineering tools that they can start making a difference with today. Graduate students who already have had an introduction to systems engineering, will be able to apply these skills even further as they develop both a systems design and implementation of their own embedded systems project. \n",
    "\n",
    "- With permission, students with limited systems engineering exposure may still take on the graduate challenge but will be required to review additional supplemental Systems Engineering materials on their own time."
