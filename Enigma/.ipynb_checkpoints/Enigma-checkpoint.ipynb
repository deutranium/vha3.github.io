    "The Enigma machine is an interesting example of historical, high-stakes, geopolitical electrical engineering. It is a rotary-electric enciphering machine that can be used to convert a string of readable plaintext into a string of garbled ciphertext. It was invented by a German engineer, Arthur Scherbius, shortly after WWI. A number of governments adapted the Enigma for encoding their communications, but it was used most famously and extensively by Nazi Germany.\n",
    "\n",
    "A string of plaintext typed into an Enigma machine became a string of ciphertext. This ciphertext could only be translated back into plaintext by someone else that also had an Enigma machine, and that knew how to configure the Enigma machine to decipher that particular message. If an Enigma machine were setup with the wrong configurations, a string of ciphertext would just produce more garbled nonsense. The security of the device came from the number of possible configurations. The device was constructed such that there were over $1.07 \\times 10^{23}$ possible configurations. Of these, *only one* would translate the ciphertext into readable plaintext. With this number of configurations, even if you could test one configuration every *millisecond*, it would take longer than the age of the universe to exhaustively search every configuration. And furthermore, these configurations would change every day. For these reasons, the Germans believed Enigma to be unbreakable. German military strategy going into WWII involved very fast tactics, which needed to be coordinated over radio. The Germans knew that these radio transmissions would be intercepted, so they encoded the transmissions using Enigma machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that the Enigma had a fatal flaw which would be exploited, enabling Allied codebreakers at Bletchley Park and elsewhere to build a machine that could crack Enigma every day. The effort to crack Enigma is famously known as Project ULTRA, and the machine that they built to crack it is the Bombe. The Bombe is arguably one of the most historically impactful machines that has ever been built. But that's the subject of a separate discussion."

    "Superficially, the Enigma machine looks a lot like a typewriter. It features a familiar-looking keyboard on top, but with some additional components that are best understood by looking the schematic. I borrowed this schematic from Graham Ellsbury's website, which is linked [here](http://www.ellsbury.com/enigma2.htm) and referenced below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just above the keyboard in the picture on below, you can see three rows of what appear to be lightbulbs. This is the lampboard, and underneath each of those lightbulbs was a letter of the alphabet (26 bulbs for 26 letters). When an operator pressed a key on the keyboard, an electrical circuit would be closed to cause one of the lights on the lampboard to illuminate. This would be the enciphered character for that key entry. The user would then press another key, and some other (or, possibly, the same) lamp would illuminate, giving them the next character in the cipher.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Enigma was incredibly difficult to crack for two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The specific circuits that connected key entries to lampboard outputs depended on the configuration of the steckerboard and rotors (each of which will be discussed momentarily), of which there were *way* too many to exhaustively search, and which changed from day to day.\n",
    "2. The internal circuitry changed *with every keypress*. The rotors inside the Enigma machine would rotate each time the user pressed a key, completely changing the internal circuitry. So, if a user keyed the string `AAAAA` into the machine, they would not get a string of 5 of the same characters back out. I setup the emulator with some arbitary configurations and keyed in `AAAAA`. The machine returned the cipher `RBUEL.`"

    "On the front of the Enigma, you can see a bunch of sockets, some of which are connected to one another by pluggable wires. This is called the \"steckerboard\" (also called the \"plugboard\"). It is reconfigurable, and it maps a particular key to some other key before sending it through the rest of the internal circuitry of the device. In the schematic shown on the right, the keyboard is represented by the 26 wires entering on the right side of the diagram. Each of these wires passes through the steckerboard. Depending how the steckerboard is configured, a particular key might get mapped to a different key. In the diagram, for example, the steckerboard maps \"A\" (the top wire) to \"E\" (the fifth wire) as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "An operator would make 10 connections on the steckerboard. That is to say, 10 letters would be mapped to other letters by the steckerboard. The remaining 6 letters would be mapped to themselves, like \"B\" in the diagram above.\n",
    "\n",
    "*A critical flaw* of the Enigma machine is that this steckerboard is reciprocal. If the steckerboard maps \"A\" to \"E\", then it also maps \"E\" to \"A\". The reciprocal nature of the steckerboard is not required for the Enigma machine to work, but it is a feature which was exploited by Turing and others to crack the ciphers."

Unlike the steckerboard, the internal connections of these rotors were not reconfigurable. However, they could be placed in the machine in any order, and there were more than 3 rotors from which to choose. So, part of the configuration of the Enigma involved putting the correct 3 rotors into the machine, in the correct order, and in the correct orientation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To further comlicate things, each of these rotors *rotated*. The right rotor would move one step every time a key was pressed. The middle motor would move one step every time the right rotor completed a full rotation, and the left rotor would move one step every time the middle rotor completed a full rotation. This meant that repeated inputs did not yield repeated outputs. The internal circuitry of the Enigma *changed with every keypress.* This is illustrated in the diagrams below, which show the path through the stecker and rotors taken by two sequential presses of 'A'. After the first press, the right rotor moves one step."
