    "[Boids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) is an artificial life program that produces startlingly realistic simulations of the flocking behavior of birds. Each \"boid\" (which is an abbreviation of \"bird-oid object\" follows a very simple set of rules. These rules will be discussed at length, but they can be summarized as follows:<br>\n",
    "- **Separation**: boids move away from other boids that are too close\n",
    "- **Alignment**: boids attempt to match the velocities of their neighbors\n",
    "- **Cohesion**: boids move toward the center of mass of their neighbors\n",
    "\n",
    "When all of the boids follow these simple rules, the flock produces gorgeously organic-looking emergent patterns, as shown in the video below. You can compare the behavior shown in the simulation below to videos of actual murmurations of starlings (like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4f_1_r80RY)). These rules are also extendable. You might add a predator that all the boids must avoid, or you might add a \"perching\" behavior where boids near the bottom of the screen rest for a moment before rejoining the flock. The Boids algorithm was developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will create a flock of boids on the TFT that will be animated at (at least) 30 fps. You are challenged to produce the largest flock that you can. The parameters which govern boid behavior will be programmable via a Python user interface, and the flock will instantly begin behaving according to the updated parameters."

    "Just like in nature, each boid does not have global knowledge of every other boid in the flock. Instead, each can only see boids that are within its *visual range* and that are within its smaller *protected range*. These are tunable parameters. A boid will move away from other boids that are within its protected range (birds don't want to fly into each other), it will attempt to match the average velocity of boids within its visible range, and it will tend toward the center of mass of boids in its visible range."

    "We will also enforce minimum and maximum speed limits for the boids. Flocking birds (like starlings) are never stationary in flight. So, we'll prevent the speed of any boid from dropping below some tunable value. Birds also have maximum speeeds, so we'll prevent the speed of any boid from exceeding some tunable value. Finally, we want for the boids to turn around when they reach the edges of the TFT screen. When a boid gets within some tunable margin of an edge of the screen, we will turn it by some tunable value. The greater this value, the faster the birds will be able to turn. We can play with these parameters until we get realistic-looking behavior."
