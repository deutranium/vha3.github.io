However, because the Earth is substantially cooler than the Sun, the radiated energy has significantly longer wavelengths. Greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere allow the short-wavelength light from the Sun to pass through to the Earth unimpeded. They absorb the re-radiated long-wavelength energy, however, and emit it in all directions. Some of this emitted energy goes back down to the Earth, creating a warming effect."

If the minerals solidified at different times, then this process would begin at different times and some would have a \"head start\" over others. The observable result would be that the Sr87/Sr86 to Rb87/Sr86 ratios for all minerals would *not* lie on a straight line."
