    "### Setting up the hardware\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Acquire a DE1-SoC from Hunter.**\n",
    "2. **Confirm the orientation of the MSEL switches.** Look at the bottom of the board. Confirm that the MSEL switches are in configuration `010101` (left to right), as specified on pages 12-13 of the [user's manual](http://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece5760/DE1_SOC/DE1-SoC_User_manualv.1.2.2_revE.pdf). If they aren't, show Hunter before you change them.\n",
    "1. **Hook up the hardware:** For most exercises there will be 5 or six connections to the board: serial, ethernet, VGA, audio (for lab 2), USB blaster, power. See the image below.<br><br>\n",

    "2. **Acquire a micro-SD card from Hunter**.\n",
    "3. Load [this Linux image](https://cornell.box.com/s/0f9fxd2azgbsnsle9zwvfk9qb5dwr3s5) onto the SD card.\n",
    "> - If you are working with a windows machine, The sections 2.1 and 2.2 [Using Linux on the DE1-SoC](https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece5760/DE1_SOC/DE1-SoC-UP-Linux/Linux.pdf)\n",
    "shows how to install Linux on an SDcard.\n",
    "> - If you are on a Mac, use something like [ApplePiBaker](http://www.tweaking4all.com/software/macosx-software/macosx-apple-pi-baker/).\n",
    "4. **Open a serial connection to the DE1 (don't boot it yet).** Use baud 115200.\n",
    "5. **Insert the SD card into the DE1.**\n",
    "6. **Boot it.** You will see a bunch of text scroll past on the serial terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuring the Linux environment\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Cornell 10space system will be used for any FPGA on the internet in the lab.\n",
    "> - The Cornell 10space system is not reachable from wireless devices!\n",
    "> - The MAC address and IP address are locked down and must match. \n",
    "> - You will use a static address assigned to your group. You may not use another group's addresses.\n",
    "1. **YOU MUST CHANGE YOUR MAC AND IP ADDRESSES.** Ask Hunter for your group's MAC/IP addresses. They will be of the following form:\n",
    "> - IP: `10.253.17.xx`\n",
    "> - MAC: `12:34:56:78:90:yy`\n",
    "2. **Write these down!!** These are sacred to your group.\n",
    "3. **From the serial command line**, navigate to `/etc/network/interfaces` and open it using a command-line editor. It will look like this:<br>\n",
    "`auto eth0\n",
    "iface eth0 inet static\n",
    "hwaddress ether 12:34:56:78:90:yy \n",
    "address 10.253.17.xx\n",
    "netmask 255.255.255.0\n",
    "gateway 10.253.17.1\n",
    "dns-nameservers 132.236.56.250 128.253.180.2 192.35.82.50`\n",
    "4. **Modify the address and hwaddress to match your group's assigned IP and MAC addresses.**\n",
    "5. Save, then run `/etc/init.d/networking restart`.\n",
    "> - If you get a eth0 error, then run `reboot`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Secure Shell Login\n",
    "\n",
    "1. From a Lab PC (or your own PC if you've VPN'd onto the Cornell network), open an ssh connection to `root@10.253.17.xx` (where xx is your group's assigned IP).\n",
    "2. The default root password is `bigred5760`\n",
    "3. **Change this password using `passwd`!!**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Going further\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read the [Linux on HPS](https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece5760/DE1_SOC/HPS_peripherials/linux_index.html) page to learn how to move files to/from the HPS, and how to compile/run C using GCC."
