    "\n",
    "The **only hardware** that goes onto the FPGA is the hardware that *you describe in your Verilog*. This has a few implications . . .\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There are no init statements.\n",
    "> - If you initialize a register in Verilog, that register will obtain that value the *first time the FPGA is programmed*, but it will not retain that value through a reset.\n",
    "> - Instead, you must build a state machine with a reset state that initializes register values\n",
    "2. There are no system calls in Verilog.\n",
    "> - Because there's no system! The only hardware on the FPGA is that which you've described.\n",
    "> - You can't call `print` because there's no printer (unless you build one)\n",
    "> - You have to describe all the memory that you will use\n",
    "> - This makes debugging *different.* You will do most of your debugging in a simulation environment, and use LED's, HEX displays, switches, and an onboard logic analyzer to debug the FPGA\n",
    "3. There are no reals/floats. \n",
    "> - You have registers, which are just collections of bits\n",
    "> - You can make that register whatever size you want, but you just have collections of bits\n",
    "> - If you want to call that collection of bits an `int` or a `float`, then *you* have to write the routines that treat that collection of bits as that data type\n",
    "4. There is no timing information in Verilog. You **do have** a hardware clock.\n",
    "> - There's no concept of a `delay(ms)` function call\n",
    "> - If you want to delay for a certain amount of time, you must count off hardware clock cycles\n",
    "5. Loops (in Verilog) are **not sequential structures.** They're **repeated hardware.**\n",
    "> - Sometimes that's what you want! But just remember that that's what these loops are doing.\n",
    "6. Modules are pieces of reusable hardware.\n",
    "> - Sort of looks and feels like a function (takes inputs, performs operations on those inputs, and returns outputs\n",
    "> - But! Everytime you instantiate a module, another *copy of that hardware* is placed on the FPGA\n",
    "7. Each \"assign\" and \"always\" happens **all the time.**\n",
    "> - If it can be happening, it is happening\n",
    "> - You can associate an always ith a logical condition (e.g. rising edge of a clock)\n",
    "8. **There is no sequentiality except for that which you build!**\n",
    "> - If you want sequential execution, build a state machine!\n",
    "9. An incomplete \"case\" or \"if\" can infer a latch.\n",
    "> - Inferred latches reviewed in a subsequent section\n",
    "> - Creates bugs that are hard to find\n",
    "> - Include a default case!"

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's consider two code snippets that are *identical* except that one uses a non-blocking assign and the other uses a blocking assign. We'll compare the hardware that each snippet builds. First, consider the non-blocking assign:\n",

It does *not execute these sequentially*, everything is executed simultaneously, but it will build a circuit that satisfies this logic. That circuit looks like this:\n",
