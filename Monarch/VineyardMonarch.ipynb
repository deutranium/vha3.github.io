As long as I was going to be gathering a dataset, however, I preferred for that dataset to be useful to people other than just myself. So, I put a new suite of sensors on the Monarchs that could measure quantities that would be of interest to vineyard managers and dairy farmers, and I gathered my case-study datasets from vineyards and dairy calves."

(In space, thermal constraints are such that a battery could not be added to the board for power storage. On Earth, there is no such constraint). An image of the device is shown below with the components labeled."

    "20 Monarchs were attached to vineyard trellis at a Cornell-operated vineyard for 5 weeks. Another 10 of these devices were attached to modified dog collars and placed on dairy calves for 2 weeks. Pictures of each deployment are shown below. In the vineyard, the experiment was to see whether the temperature conditions inside of the leaf canopies were appreciably different than those outside the canopy. At the dairy farm, the objective was simply to gather a dataset to show that this sort of experiment could be conducted. (I did the dairy experiment in collaboration with a veterinary professor, who was interested in using this proof-of-concept dataset to fund a more application-specific device with a different suite of sensors).

In particular, the light sensors ended up being an interesting data point. Calves like to sleep with their chins tucked in their forearms, which blocks the light to the light sensor on the Monarch. So, dark measurements from the light sensor during the day indicated that that particular calf was taking a nap."
