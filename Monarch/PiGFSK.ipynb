    "This webpage describes the radio receiver station that I built to conduct the experiments described on the [vineyard and cattle monitoring Monarch page](./VineyardMonarch.html). One of these receiver stations is pictured below, with all of the components labeled. This particular station was deployed at the vineyard to gather the Monarch data over 5 weeks, as described on the webpage linked previously. The station is powered by two 17W solar panels from [Voltaic system](https://voltaicsystems.com), which interface with their 24,000mAh V88 Laptop Battery. This battery powers a Raspberry Pi, which is demodulating packets being received from an RTL-SDR software-defined radio. This SDR is attached to a Yagi antenna through a low noise amplifier.\n",

    "With this ground station, I was able to consistently gather packets (at 50bps) from Monarchs up to a quarter-mile away (with no forward error correction, matched filtering, or anything). Those distances were sufficient for the tests that I was conducting."

    "The low-power transmitters (TI-CC1310's) use Gaussian Frequency Shift Keying (GFSK) to encode information at the carrier frequency. With GFSK, a logical 1 is encoded by increasing the frequency of the transmission to slightly greater than the carrier frequency and a logical zero is encoded by decreasing the frequency of the transmission to slightly less than the carrier frequency. This is in contrast to Amplitude Modulation which obviously modulates the amplitude in order to encode 1's and 0's, and Phase Modulation, which modulates the phase of the transmission (while keeping the frequency constant) in order to encode 1's and 0's. A good introductory article on these modulation schemes can be found here: https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/radio-frequency-analysis-design/radio-frequency-demodulation/quadrature-frequency-and-phase-demodulation/."

    "A discussion of the demodulation method requires a brief discussion of how the RTL-SDR sampling works. The RTL-SDR has two voltage-controlled oscillators that oscillate at precisely the carrier frequency of the transmitter (915 MHz). One of these oscillators is 90 degrees out of phase from the other. The RF transmissions received by the antenna are mixed with these local oscillators in order to get the baseband transmission. By mixing the received transmissions with both the in-phase oscillator and the out-of-phase oscillator, the RTL-SDR is able to represent the received transmission as the sum of two out-of-phase 915 MHz waves. One of these waves is in-phase (I) and the other is out-of-phase (or \"quadrature\", Q). This I/Q data is a nice way to represent the received transmissions because it is independent of the carrier frequency, and it includes phase information (which would be impossible to recover with just one local oscillator)."

    "With the I/Q data, one has all of the information necessary to demodulate any of the modulation schemes mentioned above. For Amplitude Modulation, the relevant quantity would be the amplitude of the received transmission ($\\sqrt{I^2 + Q^2}$). For phase modulation, the relevant quantity is the phase of the received signal relative to the local oscillators $\\left(\\text{atan2}\\left(\\frac{I}{Q}\\right)\\right)$. For Frequency Modulation, the information is encoded on the derivative of the phase. A procedural way to approximate this quantity is to find the conjugate product of the $n^{th}$ and $(n-1)^{st}$ samples (a complex number), and then to find the argument of the resulting complex number. If these two samples have the same phase, then the product will be a real number with argument 0. If these two samples are 90 degrees out of phase, then the product will be a purely imaginary number with argument $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. The I/Q plot for a frequency-modulated signal ends up forming a circle, since the phase of the received transmission moves continually around the complex plane. For phase-modulated signals, the I/Q plots look like a collection of dots. Letting $\\tilde{x}[n-1]$ be the complex conjugate of sample $x[n-1]$, this is represented by the below equation."
